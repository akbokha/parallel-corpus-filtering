Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing development of Israel and sheds Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; with the deal raised by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans who were partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this election with regard to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has been shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him with a slightly t@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bing on a white block , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who worked in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zi@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency one day after .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting in the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in employment policy of the university meant that the doctorate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work in 2009 at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did a doctorate in spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail left both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertaining coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , was leading the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student &apos;s committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the watch station , while the Uni@@ versities &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had made the call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his not@@ ebook called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to employ fewer workers for the holiday season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to work more hours for the employees and seasonal workers . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching and companies prepare to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees selling , sending and supplying products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox ex@@ poses his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes gradually clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gn@@ aw@@ ing and a length of ar@@ tery from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , UK and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ s and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp staying power and start letting their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps Hot popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University pointed out that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vote would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the correct temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first state @-@ state state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; yet 44 percent think he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they raise their funds , Republi@@ can voters stop Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P voters think Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mps leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is spread over more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Marco Ru@@ bio , he has 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have made their minds .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting Tru@@ mp are saying that they have firmly assigned their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; was the immigration hub in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will stop His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party , and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will appear to do so . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son have accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated at the Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely anno@@ yed .
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
&quot; in the street , a square metre of a re @-@ roof@@ ed house costs an average of ‚Ç¨ 7@@ 3,@@ 300 . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special areas one square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ ler has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German home sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
&quot; but well , who can afford it ... &quot;
by the way : Munich is without exception here at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
two tw@@ ins in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze best@@ owed a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ oth hits ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; during his 28th match in the Champions League , M√ºller was rewarded with the assistance of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who let him pass a f@@ lange of the world champion &apos;s f@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they ran bol@@ dly , but in their offensive efforts they were often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by means of game storage on the left @-@ hand market of Douglas Costa , which rarely crossed the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k penet@@ rated from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker ide@@ ye Brown hit the pol@@ o of the Pole by the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto repaired with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians got their hab@@ itu@@ al dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but on the door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye on the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said Board member Matthias Samuel at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller followed one . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ ale in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mu@@ te Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently had provoked the followers of the host of Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured in breach of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing , risk decreases rapidly . &quot;
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several collabor@@ ators of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in smokers compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before endanger@@ ing again sin@@ king to the level of non @-@ smokers , In@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking dimin@@ ishes life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings it also results in good dental health up to high age . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called floor monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Natural Monum@@ ents of Natural Monum@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists became five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves had been discovered which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman from freight elevator
&quot; after a young woman arrives at the station in the vul@@ ture line of the vul@@ ture , the Federal Police is asking the population for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by det@@ ecting the train , she carried heavy injuries to her according to the Federal Police . &quot;

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) .
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way is clearly more traditional than traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m , commission@@ er @-@ responsible for the idea . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age specifically that the EU states and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new Court of Investment .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , a claim against their judgments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , Malm@@ str√∂m has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment course according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the Investor @-@ State Dis@@ pu@@ te Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a type of parallel justice , through which companies can play damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act described the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Economic Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked with other EU @-@ trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European Business Association for Business Europe warned about limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
deli@@ ri@@ ous Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is seated on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they originated and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative artist . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; published 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; seems to blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a devi@@ ous series : each of the 50 states of the US should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is released in 2005 . &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album enters the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as long ago as the smaller clubs came up , the shows presented here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on forehead bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ ko . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens tou@@ red as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany . &quot;
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed himself for an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut is expected to debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey and for the first time put on his own with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch where his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes were proposed to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limitation of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory chief over the dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy , says that he has given &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 requests . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from tac@@ kling serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is acting under the shadow of the Minister of Economic Affairs , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also informed the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tual . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his parliamentary colleagues , even though critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and promp@@ ts far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated growth in the UK
&quot; the pound grew in sharp contrast to data , which indicate a rise in the United Kingdom pay@@ roll growth . in parallel to that , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and executed assessments on the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 ‚Ç¨ . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after take @-@ over offer of the Riv@@ age AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competitor company for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that turnover in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - has reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares increased by 5 % after mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports performance company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will pay the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and Generation U@@ 17 spins through .
how Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives will cost exactly as much as her mom@@ my E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
that says : &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I will fulfill her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is compulsory ?
who ju@@ ks it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
this has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ square , he invested three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company pur@@ ged many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber bank account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and above the counter , also Bie@@ ber cas@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; if J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others stress that , after all , Bie@@ ber is straight in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on 1st place . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings the Lebanese to the Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
&quot; both are both - and in the potato @-@ ton@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner has developed Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , his shop has turned into a barbecue , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi @-@ cul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese in the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes in the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y him . &quot;
&quot; only that much : &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary understanding of international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ a launches campaign to tackle algae decline
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA outlets from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets are boo@@ sting their relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investment strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million in sales per year and Met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ a was likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a refused to respond publicly to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ a with Mr Dou@@ glass received contact last week .
&quot; since 2010 i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail stores , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction of simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , wholes@@ al@@ ers def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to pay for sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh foods and to supply a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load refurb@@ ishment programmes are to be set to El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is rather deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ rene and ear@@ ns rather praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always called &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious examination of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have taken Kyr@@ g@@ gios , and I should sm@@ ash the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp caught a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly firmly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite un@@ event@@ ful is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to vom@@ it a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ rene during the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it reasonable and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all who tried to get illeg@@ ally to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants mut@@ ated in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
&quot; the people fle@@ eing from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; open the borders &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it is &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that by the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU countries would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having ended a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison prisoners were used at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences committed in accordance with the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos revers@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the race against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the preliminary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ ander is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is in favour of the presidential office , receives 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; your support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the preliminary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; since the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office in the balance , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the preliminary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ ander .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure fell by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er presidential election will be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important traits in voters of the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den see maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut from hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the preliminary elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are continued during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email control had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of its party , this is still a problem for it among registered voters . only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks on leadership . &quot;
&quot; out of the six candidates tested Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the failure rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l close to Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is un@@ le@@ ashed , and others lose their grip . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , went off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in the surveys - with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent pol@@ l by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking back on a car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp had found some si@@ eves for the ex neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a mon@@ astic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported . &quot;
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , to goo@@ geln their symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , &quot; &quot; said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide and put the common good of the Brotherhood about Michael Den@@ g &apos;s well @-@ being , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zi@@ di Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries . &quot;
&quot; according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment due to the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ countable , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first raise in interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could see , however , that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of an increase of interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy may react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yields from 12 to 24 months after the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob Dol@@ l , CEO of plant strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return on investment starts to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases are often promoted . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; advertising increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed all year to raise interest rates of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are quickly put in the shade after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticipated interest increase and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bor@@ rowing is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
&quot; when bor@@ rowing , the returns seem to change direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / reduction in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond returns immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a deviation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending trends have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and entire business , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial rate of interest , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers want to see gains through higher yields , even when experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General &apos;s director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anywhere else about classical music . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work should be made to engage the public as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that fell under fire during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport to tramp@@ le on commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated ¬£ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George - was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; , &quot; if the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of commission pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose at slow@@ est in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ ly cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale magazine . &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ its itself , and we may experience that the growth will be reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
last year saw five times the average number of purch@@ as@@ ers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites fell off .
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , where buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 spent a little over ¬£ 1 online .
&quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia Dis@@ counts the Coll@@ ap@@ se of Parti@@ ally the gigantic Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead which were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mo@@ urn filled , widely dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect , when the first of the dead approached their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ or Cem@@ etery . &quot;
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the bed .
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung over the building company of the bin Laden due to the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 men , who were killed when a crane over@@ threw the Great Central mo@@ ck@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was standing . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated , that the p@@ add@@ les will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , should not have left the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was prohibited foreign travel . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was able to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also called for the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mosque as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger building projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sli@@ dden son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials assume that 1 million ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed , and the same amount of permanent injured . &quot;
other los@@ ers receive half of this amount .

the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has seen a rise
&quot; this leads to the opening of 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q retail outlets throughout the country &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; because Brit@@ ons are increasingly engaged in tra@@ des@@ people to make DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the chain of construction markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices is now over@@ taken . &quot;
&quot; therefore King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fixed shops , aimed at craftsmen and closing 60 retail outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , who do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; It is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we need to move this more towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the stores .
King@@ f@@ isher who owns the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up to 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner @-@ up master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
he was legally exemp@@ ted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 had funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
sports officials are also charged with financial transactions .
&quot; this fact was the chair@@ person of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense constituted that the association did not have an asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; sports function@@ aries would only have charged allowance and the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we keep running the club or block us ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ defend@@ ant and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life assur@@ ances down as safety at the bench , &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , you are not allowed to pay any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of financial success , the withdrawal of the expense indem@@ ni@@ ties was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the expense damage was paid off only years later , namely since 2003 when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump and not detail led@@ gers also appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and directories managed the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , that is the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , against the official mis@@ use of official investig@@ ators , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant , and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; after all , he thought he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage repar@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why damage indem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him all of you are of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never sour@@ ced a cent salary , he just counted o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to present exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything was judged correct , they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the exercises are carried out in cash . in addition , he has to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with a survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the computer terri@@ bly will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions of the US @-@ computer terri@@ ers H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs should be saved in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard shares 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
&quot; the corporation , which has grown up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting itself up : the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be noted on the stock exchange .
&quot; a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC section , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services , finally ended the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; as a result , the proceeds went back to 15 of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP rep@@ lies with spl@@ itting up and massive prop@@ ens@@ ity to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans include a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would primarily face rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent showed up in agreement . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; co @-@ operation with the Syrian government Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , would be 20 percent . &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; at the heart of the fair , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility will be at the heart of the exhibition until September 27 . &quot;
&quot; after two days of press release , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility . &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; the organisers of the V@@ DA auto association reck@@ on like two years ago with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took over several hundreds of refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ a and the water @-@ th@@ row@@ er .
&quot; Euron@@ ews &apos;s correspon@@ dent , D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , has witnessed violence at the border control point . &quot;
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line had formed , and a water@@ th@@ row@@ er stood behind the polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially un@@ interrupted the pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
many tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently hurt woman was removed from the zone .
children inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
other refugees sag@@ ged in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
Serbian police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves , when the US central bank meets on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to cease increasing , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Co@@ ins at Delta State University leave excuse letters
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Do@@ cent for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He had shot at a man , and slew a man . &quot;
&quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be nervous . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police inspec@@ ting the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written record from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb ran 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; Drei@@ eck@@ s@@ relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who declared that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , 19 is , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doctorate in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as its li@@ ke@@ warm on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor has allegedly been fighting drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this surely calls for its tribute .
Kirovsky : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and inv@@ okes the fine @-@ lighted u@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment was to contribute a contribution to earnings of around ‚Ç¨ 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer responsible for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline owl should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ rov@@ ings in the management team of chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; airline companies operate under the umbrella of the airline Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective bar@@ gaining between the cockpit and the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke on this Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; in one year , the cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible with a predicted record result . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the concept &quot; Wings &quot; is in the background . &quot;
forecasts illustrate how the market is set to change . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester champion League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left external defen@@ ders to weeping and excluding him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w died in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ metre .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad deal with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers from the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in case of defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the defen@@ ders of England have an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt your opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as there seems to be always a picture or message we missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is alleged to describe the story of the book , instead returns an content of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y hopes to win the girl of his dreams , hopes to win a real tree , but he died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he states to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears Th@@ need stri@@ cken , Th@@ need stri@@ cken Th@@ need , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s collabor@@ ators but there were no further direct comments .
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a backward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting @-@ list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th emerges from the UK test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully when he will hopefully bring out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton &apos;s nine got nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to go home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first set out Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , which I set up highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of beating mos@@ ques beside Cook , causing an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receiving four Qui@@ cks , emerged and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred rounds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed by me as a young man .
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no great number of backup spinning tops that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; collaboration team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ mates will not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could win at Zul@@ auf when the economy becomes a subsi@@ dy by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented re @-@ negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought fi@@ erc@@ ely because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in different crises , as the EU now is and not always out of their own fault , Britain &apos;s own created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European boy@@ friend wishes to visit Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has been done in the out@@ performed long periods such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so perhaps some such ministers may not intentionally plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the refer@@ endu@@ ms inspired by Tony B@@ n in 1975 who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ ker &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , tel@@ eph@@ ones ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found out that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on his back on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he did not need time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ eb@@ ird tone and the wild bra@@ i@@ ding of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everybody . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs had fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussions among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital ? - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which at the start I remembered something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims by a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; where P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi@@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; signed &quot; &quot; indicating that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes should serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that on the claims by BM@@ J was already re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ en@@ ders says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programms are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least apply its production to programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad a support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ law TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series running Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ en@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the public , but they can argue , when they go to their apparent missions for justification of ¬£ 4 billion , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 a year , but for people who have a lot of money for ¬£ 150 per year , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check , train and maintain their Rei@@ chi@@ an Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said just little of BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take an example to inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching motor @-@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that em@@ powers electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels , and are found in the membranes of some of the worms . &quot;
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ onic ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when it turns ultras@@ on@@ ically onto the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired position in the brain at a optical fiber , low frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ wind@@ ed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Year , where you &apos;re in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly do not love Mar@@ m@@ ite neither loving nor hate because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I hold back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship through che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , kno@@ ck on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a bit hes@@ it@@ ant . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to stand sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the saying . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more listening music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to enter the same residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , separate yourself and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they attract all common friends to you ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments before becoming a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but pack your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single @-@ travelers , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ist@@ ers &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ bert is building row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in an interview with the 44 @-@ year @-@ old .
thousands of refugees are forced to flee to the housing market .
entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper liv@@ ing@@ room can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the flood of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very simple , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple &apos;s update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , click &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by reducing the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process has been completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth checking that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this may result in a rup@@ ture of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the holder of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , the chairman of Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contacts to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Wei√ü &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consulting , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the Social Foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , elderly and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance contributions . &quot;
&quot; for many years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; many services of the insurance companies are not often used because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new management firm Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ √≠n and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are complementary in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is dominated by both business@@ men particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ scored with the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club &apos;s lon@@ eliness : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and they invite to a regular soci@@ able applause . &quot;
&quot; with this , the social foundation stri@@ ves to make a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; foot@@ ball@@ ers once was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ national guard in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not conc@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bre@@ mer , Wiese was just cutting his hair , when he saw out how outside a park@@ ing@@ room guar@@ dian had issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese ran out of the shop , insul@@ ted the cler@@ k , and accused her of the penalty of money in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only after that will be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now taken home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove past several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a stock@@ pile , one was struck by the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; up to now , only a vag@@ ue report description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and witnesses to sign up under the telephone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller to acquire field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also looking forward to this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : on October 1 , Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of field breaks . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on hand for his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller opens the practice again on 12 October , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was symp@@ athetic at first sight , when Frank M√ºller and his wife met Frank M√ºller and his wife , Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently has completed their training in the &quot; &quot; Ver@@ den Hospital &quot; &quot; and will also go into practice next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just called them . &quot;
the Mul@@ ler liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will soon be his own boss . &quot;
and so we agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller has grown up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently acting as Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen . he was also appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz Group in 2009 and is involved in the D@@ RK @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen in 2009 .
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ir@@ ausen works as a resident doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros is received by the M√ºll@@ ers as part of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; stresses the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice during each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen .
&quot; if there was no successor , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , inci@@ dentally also continues to look into familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the wheel rest . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen , smiling . &quot;
she already felt a bit of melanch@@ oly after a long time .
&quot; but we stay in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still quite often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; up to now , I &apos;ve always been pushing hard for gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also taken up at our southern border , &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the controls on the Hungarian border continue to be maintained . &quot;
&quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear also , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; the minister said . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see so much in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily regulated as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian intends to limit its borders to refugees but not to seal them . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his land reck@@ ons with some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would agree to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor will we do this , &quot; was said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day additional buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night , about 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary may now actually be a little further to the west . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees he prepared plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; he did not design@@ ate details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to stand behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
&quot; at present , it would not be a matter of very high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrant workers - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der shops are to be taken on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our country borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; stated in the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a busy operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their err@@ ands , partly quick steps , partly comfortably stro@@ lling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keeping the city paths .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life at a glorious autumn sun and in the middle of it four big panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ef reminded her 20 years of existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously gra@@ bs to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer for long &quot; , &quot; others stop briefly , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then continue . &quot;
&quot; over and over again , little discussions develop on the br@@ ink of action , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ co association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly contributed to the opening of the people . &quot;
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteer workers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer searched for Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tiz@@ ens , she immediately reported and was there when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid enjoys doing well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another ward , consider it precious and cher@@ ish the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further education and supervision of the mort@@ al and mour@@ ning companions .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the boards described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; even there , other personal wishes can be written on postcards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with financial outlook for 2016 lowered
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a $ 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on January 4 and despite higher allow@@ ances for body@@ building transport of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has yiel@@ ded solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US $ .
six of the analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ land transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Commander two days spent this week sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for almost a decade . &quot;
a mur@@ al of the United States is threatening above them at one end of the ren@@ ounced and two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the business data shows that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could increase the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which prohi@@ bits the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a wage increase this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only indicates a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this implies a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts ease the strike by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen , in spring and early summer , said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ald , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affects the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy failed in the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate , and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the impact .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the technical decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; enam@@ el , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raise interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives returned these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement in the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think that it should be ahead of the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a bewil@@ dering number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and c@@ rock@@ ery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to walk through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping experience makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the car@@ c@@ ass ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has different take @-@ on options .
what is there : do you need anything - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ et the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store is owned by the massive freeze department . here you can find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pork , local saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for shopping trol@@ leys and for@@ klift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center , a few blocks from Philippe The Original . &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 L@@ enzen .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum @-@ seekers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe . &quot;
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is completely different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should take . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the ‚Ç¨ 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Bern@@ ese Sports Centre are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent conven@@ ing session , the executed construction application was approved unanim@@ ously without any major discussion . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the committee had decided on an application for a legal &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; liberation &quot; from a valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ compas@@ sion@@ ate first and roof top &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large roof of the roof &quot; , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - should be less than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the slo@@ ping of the roof allows no &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ au promotion .
&quot; in the next stage of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall is now presented to the District Office for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen by the surprising plans of hospital GmbH of the county , which was confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining inner station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has spark@@ ed the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer has to work with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which has more than 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; the Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as housing for asylum moving . &quot;
&quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss has not been able to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ removal to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which fisher@@ man works for over 30 years as chief physician , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener had a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action as the police announced .
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it happened to the accident was not clear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei has been established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and threw their corp@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime . &quot;
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern .
&quot; as an active participant , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also taken on Tuesday night who , according to the facts , stood up and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a suspicion arose against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest was reported to the authorities in police interro@@ gation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and laid the corp@@ se on the canal . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a load on him . &quot;
conclusion of the close circumstances of action shall lead to further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; Social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed this year . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers reside in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes substantial short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; in Germany , an apartment deficit is rising , increasing from year to year . &quot;
&quot; according to Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study , has already lost some 77@@ 0.000 living units in the metrop@@ olitan areas . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people resi@@ ded in large cities in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud on the housing market .
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ valuation options are required according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding program for refugee housing of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros was rec@@ alled . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing their way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the destruction of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , hardly more refugees arrive after the border closes . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the gate closes on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws will act as a crime to overcome and damage the border fence .
&quot; in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; one received a total of 94 applications , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped there . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
locking lat@@ ti@@ ces were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to speak out for the purpose of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , it was at the end for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ hoped @-@ minded guests at first , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said right away , we take her by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself receive a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from a ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try it after the short notice , that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued in Germany , but still beyond the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was turned off at the river Inn in front of the border . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a two @-@ brid@@ led athle@@ tic - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed them , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters &quot;
&quot; with the submission of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands fully . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first Tak@@ eover Centre , Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , has already gotten a grip on Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in a he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the country officials .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen &quot; &quot; action as well . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , there may be no need for quot@@ as to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further notice of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t bear any costs for the Republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees from three to four .
&quot; so far , your own source search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; for the time being , there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently refrain from taking these measures without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the city boss is critic@@ ising the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in an extended telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ded the further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees in Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders again is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Werk &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on to acquire some of them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining space in the building are already rented . for a further 40 percent there will be inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jutta has wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to post@@ p@@ one this project : after all , she has got an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I have thought that I should open a shop for a long time , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Europe , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has been given birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in a rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the expert woman with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag is appreciated every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s for@@ e@@ bears came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ pu@@ di@@ ates journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presi@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ √∂hn@@ til@@ is@@ ur is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wers village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to it over -@@ tens of corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots to which beside Tru@@ mp is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ circle , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because once he had been ch@@ ewing without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ lar@@ es , that &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement regards the Americans rather distant , &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
does he think that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 child @-@ go@@ ers , and also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain clim@@ ber village .
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 resident village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten@@ ed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; to date , Sun@@ rise has reached 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the singer star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe has an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia sold 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 scored . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which didn &apos;t manage to che@@ er the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman who finally landed at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor was kept in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally committed an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips locked until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have beha@@ ved in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s home visit made her clear that Wood is &quot; the one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL spin @-@ off .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams looking for inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a scra@@ m@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first punch return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to Pun@@ t and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sulph@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sulph@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL &apos;s debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL spin @-@ off .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a t@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

&quot; because of the high refugee population , the Free Elec@@ tors demand the employment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn show in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get rewards in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Elec@@ tors meets up to Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course the subject will over@@ lay the subject of asylum , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as reported during the 199@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor chief . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts in charge of asylum seekers : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we would need uniform federal standards throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves off , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table . &quot;
a long term burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot &quot; middle level plus &quot; pilot project at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
stronger Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
&quot; after a wide range of routes , the German stock market has concluded a trend @-@ free and nervous commercial process with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a strong pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately boo@@ sted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;

solid profits also beat trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently recorded some 1 percent in sales . &quot;
many stock markets expect markets until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the major decline on the fut@@ ures markets on this Friday .
&quot; the discussion surrounding the load from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has temporarily pushed the RW@@ E &apos;s shares to a record low , and also left deep traces on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;
the federal government den@@ ies the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the D@@ ax peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; contributed from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors at present gave too little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investment in forward @-@ looking w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers by the Daimler and BMW motor@@ coaches grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 People killed after polic@@ eman shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after police shot rubber stories into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an expan@@ se district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Head of the District Police , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be capable of killing them , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on the southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ lar@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain stipul@@ ations in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday . &quot;
building area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete proposals are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Old Post &apos;s Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor may be challenged is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe / Stra@@ it Big Street , just a few months ago and demol@@ ished the building on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday village at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their recreational drug
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investor and administration sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ick went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it was good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro projects have been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among the land@@ lords who had come to the meeting called for the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , a mer@@ cen@@ ary and a member of the Board of Directors at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z overlooking all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears as many other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come so that it counts , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first of all , we must have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches Dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ donation campaign , which is intended to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ ze the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
&quot; rather than letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / may be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also flee from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with Type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven effective for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight relative to size , is considered to be normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily obes@@ e . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabe@@ tic treatments approximately the same at 29 .
&quot; among those undergoing surgery , 36 % of diabe@@ tic disease was completely and 28 % in part . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in blood pressure checking , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , &quot; said the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also yiel@@ ded average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater results in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years compared to a group that tried conven@@ tionally more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming to persons with a BM@@ I below 35 interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , with no increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have tied up their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - The Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics trials .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama was lob@@ b@@ ying Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he took violence and this provoked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in taking of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the United States report an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , the strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in infants , few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sy@@ ringe from following straw@@ berry dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lost her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by taking anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; the police considered the disgu@@ sted plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and instructed disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;re feeling pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ lls Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; at the moment de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of Celtic @-@ games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they speak of the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggle has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who now have five points ahead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like this - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously during January transfers

&quot; the former boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this high season to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people working for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the level of the UK@@ s , as the figures from the National Statistics Institute ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland had made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as seats , a more mak@@ eup lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .

tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese accused him of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a unnecessary death .
persu@@ ade Man to hunt for the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; a man of Per@@ th &apos;s attempt to abandon the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale &apos;s police was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peac@@ ekeeping incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t get out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tries to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he focused on ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s Integr@@ ity Unit , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tone sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too highly hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around head around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before that M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves on their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to summ@@ ari@@ ze me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should that bring me to the view that it becomes personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is making them think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s Fru@@ str@@ ations level was based on the long @-@ ling@@ ering cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the unbe@@ aten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ es@@ days treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ rief , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man with a collision with a cycl@@ ist and following driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having been hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia told the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and under @-@ las@@ h@@ ed assistance and due to other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable condition . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals on alle@@ gations of ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the N@@ RL &apos;s &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ees allowed the storm players &quot; ring @-@ fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett did a hardly disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample case &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defended the worst of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling of the tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was very confident , as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team . &quot;
&quot; this shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring @-@ fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock to him . &quot;
it is funny how this always comes up at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ dious team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a mess . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger faith because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and no d@@ ots something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase . &quot;
the storm team released this weekend because they won the right either to receive North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the semi@@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly threatening a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get in possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and laid down in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mac@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota response .
&quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole set and that in the cafe could have been a harmless foundation . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape by Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police of his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours until 2 am .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg captured the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches used to search for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he had done so , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping . &quot;
she also saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have recorded un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not before court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; may be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in rem@@ and for hear@@ ings on other still pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
tu@@ g@@ boats switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up beyond the control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest by the people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the River Inn River Inn and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and dam .
&quot; there , they are received by German polic@@ emen and passed on to the registration . &quot;
&quot; according to Federal Police reports at the Munich Central Station , more refugees met again in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , in 17@@ 59 , refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : pioneer of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest forecast
meteor@@ ologists warn against stor@@ ks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area beyond Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the off@@ shoots of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance area with arches of 60 to 90 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the bulk makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the International Motor Show .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving forward with the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is introducing a new entry beneath the biggest competitor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , with three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available in five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be shown next to the Astra at the IAA and new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra con@@ ten@@ ders M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade , it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan watch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp , is offered . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hands on the front part : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI can be found at the compact class at the IAA in the compact class . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are di@@ gni@@ fied
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court gave right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Det@@ ention Unit , Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of her human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on free foot according to his lawyer &apos;s information , had been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges cancelled the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a statement of compensation was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in April , they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , man un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell with no separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had concluded a decent housing in a parallel incident in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even thu@@ gs should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ Point , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 will fall off in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create that . &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
&quot; according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of the Interior ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , apartments are annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as was previously built ( 250@@ 000 dwell@@ ings ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in paid rental properties : yearly 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 housing apartments drop out of the rental price , and in order to make these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also be able to apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings annually would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ ot@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , the asylum seekers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of qualified staff , there is a majority of view that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
&quot; to date , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that workplaces are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the building of networks is the Royal Road to the Func@@ tioning of the Thr@@ one . &quot;
&quot; Berlin &apos;s school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ ten , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oting parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ sche@@ du@@ t , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ains from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude . &quot;
&quot; for refugees , access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because refugees with a refund or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not get any obligation , since they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; patient @-@ based refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this span will shor@@ ten to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this gap must be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; in the future Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ churches law into a new state @-@ religious relationship . &quot;
it is also important to establish an Islamic charity organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to heed the fundament@@ alism of religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will need to change , and the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law for a decade . &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series was showing how the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that were expected so far , writes the doctor &apos;s president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be invested in the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery orders to hand out health cards to all the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
services rendered could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to cut so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors above all do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that immigrants are worse informed of their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in hospitals , also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpreting services would have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have been helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in refugee children , for example , there is significantly more un@@ treated disability , and in the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other clinical pictures , German doctors would come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , even relief in sight is possible by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed education system , several refugees even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take another ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to the German Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist &apos;s Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the TU Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from the so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardiac ab@@ norm@@ alities and fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , severe fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill @-@ ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites into the man@@ ege on a tile with bun@@ ni@@ es to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ acher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto stands the current stage of man@@ e@@ genesis .
the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for the lovers is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to get rid of people from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer @-@ long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family casts its spell over the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to easily record the Cuban duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - these words identify them .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon s@@ alt@@ ars , the rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ ty . &quot;
balance bike on a ball ?
for He y@@ uan no problem .
snake men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitudes of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if it is not good for our animals it is not good for us either .
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes as possible . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena either . &quot;
the top commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the circus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether there are five or more 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to your performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe is holding a wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by opposition members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; during his speech on the State of the Nation in the parliament last month , it was interrupted - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the Democratic Change Movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity is ending in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers posed by politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says a company statement . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to produce electro @-@ equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the turning away from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that tight @-@ focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have scored the most vulnerable days .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal expects an improvement in the risk of injuries sustained during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season . &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening and measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal pushed the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by the distant hopes to lead the club to its first European debut with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in store to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Festival : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friendship
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , like suicide rate among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ere ( Cal@@ m campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football spots in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone pastoral ministry , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened by suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interaction between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone might help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed setting for celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ √º@@ ts , di Maria met as a PS@@ G player who took the French master on his way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scor@@ ched a head @-@ ball@@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , also in Group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they received the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team in one of three changes that could last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and passing beautifully into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ gli@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had scrat@@ ched the first half in no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had started it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored its sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a lef@@ tist f@@ lange of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malm@@ √∂ could come back to the game , and only a superb intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
a hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion $ through share purchases
&quot; Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , who is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion US $ on Wednesday as part of his huge school student plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately ‚Ç¨ 1.6 billion to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn cr@@ ushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the edition of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock market at the early Wednesday morning trading .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
&quot; the company sold its new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month confirm the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we do nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ en@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in summer 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this now works for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns weren &apos;t running with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the grass , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays wide variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it during the cast of the film and not during the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian joined . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of dear White People chose the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his rage about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the tweet earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lights since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement had a nation @-@ wide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince introduced the Gram@@ my Awards to the movement during the release of the nominated albums of the year . &quot;
&quot; album quietly , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crown first champion
professional ath@@ lete and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the finale . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster and made him the winner .
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock over winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pil@@ es of money . &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive some prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as if they had changed roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tiger .
&quot; in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb inside a board of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to believe over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad A@@ mos . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside 6 times and allowed three runs .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to focus completely on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6th July .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the sleeping bag well , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better at bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three rounds in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish run at the second , Ver@@ hagen gave the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
&quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth session , added a Insurance run , wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ owed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit had benefited from an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three races against the veter@@ an veter@@ an who had been deleted from the vulner@@ ability list before the game , after he had been missing for more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , there were ushes a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers grew in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four kn@@ itting outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP will remove Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who were anger@@ ed therein should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ended on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 pending refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there . &quot;
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days , according to the government presi@@ dency of the government of Gi@@ essen , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking of military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he presented the European states as &quot; collective far@@ sight@@ ings . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup was passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict escal@@ ates in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
Austrian Minister for Home Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF and nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees passed the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers intend to take a new trial at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) for a binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee tragedy in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lines , those people who need protection , complain that too . &quot;
&quot; but if you do not have a stay , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was in@@ timi@@ dated in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania ended with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers to travel across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
room Son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ app@@ eth . &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; spac@@ ecraft .
&quot; accordingly , the moon is stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange rate is only small , but too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a longer time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles , and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of the Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 M√ºnchen several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen has to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around one month to Val@@ det R@@ ama offensive player .
an examination showed a reduction in ad@@ duc@@ tor in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old and shared the association .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; probably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ etic loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ √§ger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious injury . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ go are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; the exotic fruits nevertheless are healthy : there are B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; for those who eat the fruits , it supports the body &apos;s vision , immune system and metabolic processes . &quot;
&quot; when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 subsidies for the Christmas business in the United States .
&quot; the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 subsidies . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have previously made arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ tower , then distinctive cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ √∂hn stops in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ alle &apos;s valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings strong rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently lying on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest stre@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ √∂hn stops in the night through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the hair @-@ dryer until Thursday morning blows in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ √∂hn can penetrate into the adjacent middle area , and on the mountains even or@@ cans of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity at the alpine slope begins to st@@ ow . &quot;
here is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , in the south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square meter has to be accounted for in the next 48 hours , this after rainf@@ all has already fallen during the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the f@@ √∂hn winds off the air , in consequence a cold front with strong , partially blown rain from west to east winds over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is blowing strongly up to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures drop considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in northern autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the community of evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
with the square I will symbo@@ lically see that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he found the city as a low @-@ income s@@ inner ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later battle against Rome . &quot;
Luther with his thes@@ es had initiated the split in the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the painting was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs . &quot;
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , this may seem quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have ar@@ isen which dev@@ ote themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he has fascinated several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Old and translated into today , into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; these are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing took place with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to be able to carry myself back with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; today , the perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the images , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the topics that are important to him , including mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; a year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration caused uncertainty , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want the train . &quot;
&quot; so hills slo@@ ping down , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval was received in October and was able to share the first common Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year still happens , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further memorial &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , with the Bundes@@ liga a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football is responding to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister for State , Ms E@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and would help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Trust , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; will be carried . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chief Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to go away . &quot;
&quot; we football feder@@ alists can , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro Cup against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees in their places had started their own projects , be great . &quot;
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : chief executive officer loses sight of an accident in the event of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest Software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after midnight on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped onto a water glass that he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then tow@@ ed out onto the street - that he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could , however , pursue his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; full of work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP head office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; to him it is important to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to stand up once you fall down .

Federal Football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low F@@ eller in the Gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
&quot; the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga , also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) . &quot;
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its el@@ eventh position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door @-@ guard position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master @-@ keeper Roman B√ºr@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football team praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all of Europe &apos;s league matches in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ fiel@@ der R@@ eus , that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robotic cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Motor Show IAA from a &quot; new era of mobility . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide for less traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries who also come together at the International Motor Show with representatives of the industry .
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise in digital radio broadcasting . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently underway on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks be born , &quot; the German government wants to &quot; check &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ internationally for the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are expected to come only well after 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany in 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute for testing , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , this could at least imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , in traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each fourth would not leave the car under control under any circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current status , the D√ºssel@@ dorfer wants to beat only in singles at the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf , head of the European Championship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also missed , and we became Europe champion . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth World . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : mannequins , which , thanks to video projections , look terri@@ bly human . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the B√ºrger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; For me an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ die . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely op@@ aque work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was used : to fr@@ oth the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have r@@ att@@ led 14 tonnes of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special highlight : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , in@@ timi@@ dating fashionable Geh@@ versuche do by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
later he himself taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them naturally .
he did not pay the models for his first own fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry top as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make a few meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , processed them to blankets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called a few examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styles is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the Industry Association of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ¬Æ and Sti@@ ckers . &quot;
only they can wear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , up to now , to Russia and to the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also seeks to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have been introducing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ s√§ch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small chi@@ cks at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister , Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe , was inspired by this : &quot; previously I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ¬Æ . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball @-@ tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s top - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en Peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a re @-@ film , but a continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already standing firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI p@@ ushes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally controlled business environment is assured and the market is more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies vis @-@ √† @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as announced in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of ven@@ om .
&quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU mandate , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already bur@@ dened so strongly today with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed on the basis of the current limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limits of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually very low enough to keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal for humans that is highly enrich@@ ing through the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; already small amounts can , especially in the case of un@@ born damage , cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants come across more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted out of the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
