&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the States for the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) If the community acc@@ uses either a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a given nam@@ ing , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the community to appro@@ ve the nom@@ ination of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded by conducting surveys due to this agreement , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after the General Director of the Organization - in the following referred to as the &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - with the aim of taking appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can indeed fulfill their tasks . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the Organization for the knowledge of reliable confidential information .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards for this Convention are concluded with respect to core material when the community and the organization realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is under the point of securing measures taken by Bel@@ ang , or has practically not been re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention the transfer of core material from the states which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures after this Convention .
&quot; as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over the responsibility for this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which each passing and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the backup measures to the given core material is emerging . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to preventive measures under this Convention , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the Community agreed with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures may be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non @-@ application of the preventive measures .
&quot; B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are not used for so long , as the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the scheme will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation will be held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material contained in the state or the respective states , and on any passing on such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an under @-@ sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or individuals who are subject to their sovereign power , however , are extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has cleared up in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability cover for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim to the Community or the State against the Organization or the Organization against the Organization or the Organization against the Community or State for Dam@@ ages - with the exception of damages resulting from a nuclear incident - is governed by international law in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the fac@@ tual information submitted by the General Director , the Council shall ensure that the organisation is not able to verify itself by verification that no core material , which has to be subject to preventive measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons , can then be reimbur@@ sed to the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and may also take the measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which weight has been acquired by the applied safety measures , takes into account the Community or the State - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , shall be accompanied by an arbit@@ ral tribunal , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators ; the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators designated as arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who ch@@ aired the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint such arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding to the Organisation , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the Treaty and shall become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant State of the Organisation is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; II ) If the association of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall promptly inform all Member States of the Organization by any amendment of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and States receives written notification , that its procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
( B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
the term used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the execution of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required .
&quot; the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a tur@@ no@@ ff by the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; to reach the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and monitoring as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the check @-@ in by the organisation is done by an explanation , in which material quantity not proven for a certain period of time is specified below the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their checks , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in applying their backup measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the amounts of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , lost or otherwise from stock , core material and quantity ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedure for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) The processing of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safegu@@ ards for this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium containing material which is not yet reached under letter c ) entered into states , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the prerequ@@ isites stated in Article 11 . if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is temporarily unable or desired from residues , so the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are mutually agreed that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is more than 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , from these security measures , if the total material quantity liberated in the States is at no point in time as a result of this article . &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should a liberated core material be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements which , in the extent required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization pursuant to this Convention , determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall be applied . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements enter into force at the same time as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , the organization presents a summ@@ ar@@ ised inventory of all the core material underlying the safegu@@ arding of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigation . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; the E@@ WG has decided to contribute to the special action plan agreed at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ age problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve that goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; Special Account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds which member states have to contribute to the special account ; this account is called &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; by the organization ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debt of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special account and to be deposited in the deposit of the organization in the respective country . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different date agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may be able to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school @-@ j@@ acks in order to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
( II ) the extent to which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exec@@ utable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are valued , approved and managed for the purposes stated in letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special account must not be used instead of the board of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization &apos;s loans granted by the organization ; therefore , they are ref@@ unded in 50 years in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ unded in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay for this check are to be paid directly to the organization they retain .
&quot; any special loan loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is given in particular . &quot;
&quot; income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which may be the bene@@ fici@@ ary at the time of loan grant , recipients of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments made by special transactions are made to the special account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred as soon as possible by the administrator to the member state . &quot;
the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ WG prior to the complete allocation of all special transactions for the audit by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special loan loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loan loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; upon full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ WG noti@@ fies as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special account , the amounts paid to the account and withdraw@@ als deposited in the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the funds of the special account from time to time , lead to a exchange of ideas on the status of the special account , the progress of programmes or plans financed by special transaction accounts and all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement has not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date in which the EEC and the Organisation may be agreed , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the total capital amount paid by the recipients is returned and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States elect the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two papers in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each wording is equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence for the amendment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T is issuing the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this programme includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation of a Joint Business pursuant to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; - will be transferred . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; because up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion even extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work which has gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by amal@@ gam@@ ating its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for both sides , and accordingly the common objective of this research work , i.e. , to achieve the cost @-@ effectively competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programs defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it will be expanded or modified by the organs referred to in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place at the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association assigned in paragraph 1 is carried out by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom Programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are referred to as &quot; Association organs , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom also contributes to ensuring that Switzerland is involved with the time of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint venture J@@ ET with the date of entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , whose aim is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association intended in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement will , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to ensure that the best possible outcomes are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - called &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , takes on this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated institutions and arran@@ ges their T @-@ sight@@ edness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme and the scientific and technological developments that are emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the groups of advis@@ ers , which the VG research proposals provide in view of the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development works that are referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , will fulfill this task with regard to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which have adequate proposals for the best possible use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in conducting the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research responsible representatives of any member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the program and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programmes and defining its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the directors committee , the advis@@ er groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same shall apply to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties work on the works of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme according to this agreement is set annually on an amount that stands at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland , to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint undertaking as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland re@@ jects an amount to the Common Business J@@ ET , which is to be defined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission informs the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the respective year is envis@@ aged . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are laid down in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of duties or other donations as well as import restrictions and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or acquired there may not be utter@@ ed free of charge or free of charge in this country unless otherwise approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to sal@@ aries and pensions that are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge stipulated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on the Exchange of Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge required for Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Common Business J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the statutes of the Common Enterprise .
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programmes according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this Agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be shared by Switzerland and the individuals or companies in Switzerland that justify access to these knowledge , under the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of member states &apos; demands within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial support
&quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot;
&quot; the agreements may be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total amount of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans as well as if possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening program . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings were not made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the accor@@ ds would be made in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be subject to the Bank &apos;s resources , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the given time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot;

the parties of the Convention on Con@@ duct of Article VII of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement ( herein@@ after referred to as the Convention ) -
&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and on the request expressed by the Committee for trade negotiations at its congress of 11 and 12 April 1979 , expressed wish to enter into a uniform version of an agreement to carry out Article VII of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement , &quot;
&quot; in view of this , article 27 of the Convention on Chan@@ ges has not yet entered into force - I &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . recognise that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this Convention shall be inadequate for some developing countries by five years in accordance with Article 21 paragraph 1 in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a development country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ iry of the deadline stated in Article 21 ( 1 ) , whereby the contractual parties have such an application in cases where the development country can offer good reasons , ben@@ evol@@ ent ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . recognize that developing countries , which currently carry out customs value determination on the basis of fixed minimum values , would possibly want to make a reservation to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions to which the contracting parties agree to be retained ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . acknowledge that developing countries who believe are revers@@ ing the order of application on request of the complain@@ ant in accordance with article 4 can cause actual difficulties for them , the wish may have the following reservation to make Article 4 : &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import@@ ation of provisions concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the quantity of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community claims the protective clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the access of Argentina to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to import of the products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ck set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which will be taken into account under the number 5 ho@@ ech@@ est rate of exhaus@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity stated in number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of slaughter body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat in the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the sales of food st@@ alls on frozen meat due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance , not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms shall be interpreted in a manner which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities specified in this agreement , export licenses are given for the products mentioned in number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products originating in Argentina from the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for obtaining the import license for the products in question .
&quot; furthermore , implementing regulations stipul@@ ates that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority prescri@@ bes the quantities in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and worked smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the hammer , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the market conditions on these markets , including conditions that are of importance to the purpose mentioned in number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount , which is valid from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year , is set in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share your government &apos;s consent .
I honor to confirm the input of your present writing with the following wording :

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that the normal sales of New Zealand hammer and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;

&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood sample is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was merged before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after the blood withdrawal is finished , the bottle must be closed immediately and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 ° C. After that , it must be opened again immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; moder@@ ately , the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not be more than 220 ml per liter of human solid blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not fall below 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined beforehand by the blood cells and serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; in so far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;

&quot; the human whole blood is to be stored in sterile , closed bottle before micro@@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 ° ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the time required for testing and transportation , which must be at most 30 minutes , on which the blood is to cool again to 4 to 6 ° . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which most of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cells components can be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which was added after plasma removal . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) must be indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the extraction must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , thus indicating its volume and composition on the label . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted by drying out the liquid , which is deposited at the top during centri@@ fu@@ ging or sedi@@ mentation of human solid blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the liquid quantity , from which one went out with the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution thus obtained must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not contain visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh serum sample ) are a dangerous content of isch@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ il@@ glut@@ in@@ ins have been determined are excluded .
&quot; unless the plasma is mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the removal of the blood , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to l@@ essen the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ vial hepatitis , mixtures are to be taken for plasma extraction , which do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; the amount of fluid in the production of the plasma is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes , from 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another substance given on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured with an ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ tr@@ ation is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum fer@@ til@@ isation in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the flow of blood in total volume .
&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group identification , International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to identify most specific@@ s is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter releases the re@@ agent &apos;s di@@ lution in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , for which international standard preparations are available ( at the time of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed based on the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory result test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents based on the label is based on the results of the durability trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents identified for the international exchange should not be d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group identification are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount that is in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools to reinforce effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their active portion in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing &quot;

&quot; based on article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , which &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; in order to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties of human origin from all input charges ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls within the jurisdiction of the Community which has been established according to the contract by which it was established , which has the necessary powers ; &quot;
&quot; from the date of its entry into force , this supplementary protocol is part of the Convention . from this point onwards , a state cannot become contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , to all states and the European Economic Community any acceptance or objection according to Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this additional Protocol to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the border form@@ alities and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; as of 1 January 1988 , the Community decided to introduce a unified administration paper within the action programme to strengthen the internal market . &quot;
&quot; in THE observation that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a uniform management paper , &quot;
&quot; in the de@@ fle@@ ction that this Convention may not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the contractual parties from their obligations from other international agreements , &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified administration paper ( herein@@ after called Single Resolution ) is introduced , which is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common delivery method ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are gro@@ uted by means of a consistency paper , for which pre @-@ prints are to be applied according to the patterns in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the consistency paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out explicitly applicable legislation in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the consistency paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the parties involved , so that they may come upon request for the pleasure of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , in terms of further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned must not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be permitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must be submitted subsequently , with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c anth@@ ology , to be submitted within the period specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 may be permitted , instead of using the consistency paper . &quot;
&quot; if the consistency paper is used , all parties involved with the approval of the relevant authorities may contribute to the completion of all the delivery and import@@ ation associated with the import and import@@ ation of common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the form@@ alities for their whole goods traffic or for part areas ;
&quot; - for shipments which include several types of goods , for the completion of delivery of delivery charges , instead of supplementary sheets for consistency paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow applications to be created , if necessary , by public or private data processing facilities according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - permit the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and if necessary , if necessary , without submitting a written notification ; &quot;
&quot; to allow the competent authorities to fores@@ ee in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , that the import , shipping or import alert can be carried out either by entering the data processing system or if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing facility ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply the facil@@ itation , adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the form@@ alities necessary for the export , shipping and import of goods by means of the consistency paper are laid down in An@@ nex II to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre @-@ print listed in An@@ nex I , shall be found in An@@ nex III to this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) The registration shall be carried out in one of the official languages of the contracting parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country where the form@@ alities for the export or shipping shall be authorised .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the destination country or transit country may require a translation of the application into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In accordance with paragraph 1 , registration shall always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import @-@ country , if they are carried out in this country by the use of others as the copies of the registration or customs duties submitted . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or its representative may use the cre@@ denti@@ als required for each individual process section between the contracting parties , which may only be used in this one paragraph , to which , if necessary , the required copies may be included in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the particular provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , however , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the delivery and shipping procedures are transferred to one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies provided for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be satisfied as far as possible that the details contained in the copies of the registration in the individual cases agree . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other upon request or - if they consider it of interest for another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be wholly or partly denied or rejected , if the sought @-@ after country considers its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or harm a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the respective decision and its grounds must be communicated irre@@ par@@ ably to the seeking country . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) En@@ tries the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which she could not afford if she was seeking , so she points to this circum@@ stance in her request . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained in paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection granted to the national law of the country , which it has received , for information of this type . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which it has given , and subject to any restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
( 1 ) A mixed committee shall be used in which any contracting party of this Convention is represented .
&quot; ( 4 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall establish a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the president and the duration of his term . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub @-@ committees and working groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task of managing the Convention and ensuring its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the Committee shall regularly inform the contractual parties about practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; it speaks out recommendations and in cases takes 3 decisions in accordance with paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall make amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention , as well as the conveni@@ ences mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last resort of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee shall be approved a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall come into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party will take appropriate measures to ensure an effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this agreement , with the need to take into account the difficulties inherent in the transport of goods as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions on all sides when applying the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the other hand , on the one hand and for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention applies also to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality of the Swiss Con@@ federation is connected by a customs union agreement .
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to a twelve @-@ month period ; the written notice shall be addressed to the Dep@@ os@@ it@@ ar , which is mentioned in Article 17 , which it noti@@ fies to all other parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the contracting parties have deposited their acceptance certificates in the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities until November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Agreement does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , so on the first day of the second month following the final acceptance of the final acceptance document , it enters into force . &quot;
&quot; this Convention is written in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish , Spanish , Portuguese , Swedish , and Spanish . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will come as far as possible to this request . &quot;
&quot; 2 . faced with the responsibility of the Commission on issues of management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the existing situation and the reports of its Advisory Committee of Fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how the co @-@ operation between the two parties will intensi@@ fy , and in particular to examine the possibilities offered by the Commission to establish a closer connection to the Advisory Council Committee of the Council . &quot;

&quot; the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings , which are conven@@ ed at the special request of the Commission . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be extended on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; each party always has the courage to withdraw from the agreement at any time , with respect to a one @-@ year period of notice . &quot;
&quot; in terms of clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognize the observer status at meetings of the Advisory Committee on Fish@@ eries Management in the Council . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the Commission &apos;s representative would have the right to ask for the word and to participate in meetings , but would not have the right to change the agen@@ das of the meetings . &quot;

&quot; in the de@@ fle@@ ction that the development of technology and the structures of international trade made significant changes to the Brussels agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of goods into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE observation that the degree of differentiation required by the governments and the economy for customs tari@@ ffs and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that the harmon@@ ised system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of different modes of transport , &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included in the systems used for the name and coding of the goods , as far as possible in the systems used in the trade . &quot;
&quot; in THE MA@@ K@@ ING that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to bring about as close reci@@ pro@@ cal relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE estimate that a close inter @-@ relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the international trade mark for the foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations shall be respected , &quot;
&quot; in the de@@ fle@@ ction that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff tari@@ ff and statistics code , which is appropri@@ ated for use by international trade parties , &quot;
&quot; in THE observation that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for cooperation in the field of customs services for the harmon@@ ised system in this field , &quot;
&quot; in THE MA@@ K@@ ING that - although the aforementioned agreement on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff has proven to be an effective instrument to achieve some of these aims , the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;

the contractual parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a council for cooperation in the field of customs
&quot; it is desirable that , on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE first weighing , that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned convention , the time of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain in@@ secure . &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of the goods , referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , paragraph 1 receives the following form : &quot;

&quot; B . every state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention on the entry into force of this Protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version amended by the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; a plant which is indispensable not only for the entertainment and maintenance of soils , but also the utilization of land which does not allow any other planting , and that even in the case of extensive management , which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , has responded favor@@ ably to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that its cultivation will depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , fully dependent on the measures required to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that olive oil and table olive oil are essential ingredients in the fields , in which the olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers &quot; income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all special difficulties which seriously harm the interests of the producers and consumers , and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the general policy of economic growth in countries that lie in zones where the cultivation of olive trees is common ; &quot;

&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the measures necessary in view of the particular circumstances of the olive growing and the market for olive products go beyond national boundaries , and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the 1956 International O@@ live Convention , in its amended version and the International O@@ live Convention of 1963 in its revised and amended version and the International O@@ live Convention of 1979 ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ W@@ US@@ ST@@ SE@@ IN that it is essential to continue and develop the work begun within the framework of the aforementioned tre@@ aties , and that it is desirable to include a new agreement - &quot;
