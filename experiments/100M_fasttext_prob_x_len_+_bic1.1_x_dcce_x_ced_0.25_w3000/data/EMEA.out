&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Survey Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have alternating periods of normal atmosphere ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as much as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , is used to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing re@@ occurring . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol over twelve weeks , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ e ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also effectively reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled shr@@ ink@@ age ) , fatigue ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were responding to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with a lack of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displaying mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals used as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no higher risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ign ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease ( 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , patients treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these trials , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ g@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ a , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; considering the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weighed the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ height prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data protection for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appeared compared to patients treated with semi @-@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l include the mal@@ ign neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without sequence of death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose as Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist action on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D and D@@ 3 receptor and a ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % and semi @-@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ mine scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy similar to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operated in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partly not associated with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ mission , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in extensive metabol@@ isers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects were observed . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study for patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( child @-@ pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al rin@@ ds in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , the concentrations found in the study of more than 39 weeks were found in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist action on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may alternatively take the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partly not associated with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ mission , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were after dos@@ ages , which lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical stage . &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may alternatively take the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals used as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , the treatment should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist action on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
97 in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in tablet form for healthy volunteers .
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick check of as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the pharmaceuticals already used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tray or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ections solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ign ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ g@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ a , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was greater compared to the after all@@ u@@ vial administration of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used intra@@ muscular and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ height prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared with the after all@@ u@@ vial administration of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ tis / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in terms of as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ine reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be observed due to a decreased patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partly not associated with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ mission , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
in 2 studies with healthy subjects the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no immediate toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were taken after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15 ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional trials with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , significantly exceeded by the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al rin@@ ds in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane dealt with the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were no differences between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicator indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
patients who previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
&quot; in addition , it should not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood or before the treatment commen@@ ces . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel pen@@ al@@ ants it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavier sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for recommen@@ ding dose adaptation in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel with significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ asing number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac pre @-@ cases in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients experience nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ cs and con@@ sti@@ tious methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not require effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child , during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm cell conservation , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
&quot; in the following , the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , tender g@@ ums , loose chair , ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , head@@ aches , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
&quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive , related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ ul@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules drug that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular bul@@ b and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to in@@ hibition of their de@@ hydr@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans @-@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients with two armed un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel in 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposition ( AU@@ C ) rose from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration took place in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient is 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; patients at the age of more than 75 years , however , are only few data available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .

this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; in patients with normal blood glucose levels , complications may occur in patients with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible before the surgery and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may occur . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used against operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an injection into a vein as part of a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , Ab@@ ze@@ amed was compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected to a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed stre@@ amed stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ y@@ amed must not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ ze@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union law , Ab@@ ze@@ amed has demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to permit the marketing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned greater operational interventions that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
&quot; the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the symptoms .
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the dose of the dose of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the amount of the amount &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the number of cells increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood dispens@@ er program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients who are diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ene ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia or PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , companion and underlying diseases in patients who are not eligible for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery ; severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the cardi@@ oid or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident ; in patients with a recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ene ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the dose should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the reci@@ pro@@ cal coefficient , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; &quot; real &quot; &quot; index &quot; &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA can be weighed . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis stimul@@ ants ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the application of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in case of maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy for patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically cured cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumor patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptoms of symptom@@ atic an@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumour tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; more than th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ate can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate part , with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses . &quot;
survival and progression were investigated in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in controls due to various common malign@@ omas . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ gic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and might be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ fold of the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased f@@ ö@@ cular body weight , dela@@ ying the oscill@@ ation and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum of 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued @-@ on label , so if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

&quot; the holder of the approval for placing on the market has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of member states : • Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorization for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in version 3.0 and is operational in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is operational before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is applied in the traffic . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as well as in version 5 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Risk Management Plan adopted in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , which may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) • following the request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
• Have a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of a drop of blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if you have performed such a drop of blood for example
&quot; you suffer from severe diar@@ rho@@ ea in the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial ar@@ tery disease ) , the vascular disease ( vascular disease of the car@@ rots ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can come within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts , which is reg@@ ressed during further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , the dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the start of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ene after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y , it will break off your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs with inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of hem@@ at@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood lip@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , and adjust your ab@@ et@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be weighed down to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor in certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if an orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ minent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before treatment commen@@ ce and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have used it recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for the development of the immune system , e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers it appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ular thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy . &quot;
&quot; eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution in the use of se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may happen - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood propag@@ ation after surgery ( postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your departure level is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects may affect you significantly or if you notice side effects not stated in this use information .
&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip as in h@@ inf@@ alli@@ um ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms that occur in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with o@@ steopor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ builds bone substance ) in the blood once again decreased or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are subjected to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta manufactures educational material for physicians to prescri@@ be the A@@ cla@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract supplement in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data on safety and efficacy are missing . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia is to be treated before starting the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ a@@ emia may develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be weighed before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive tooth treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental operations , there is no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after A@@ cla@@ sta administration may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were expressed as decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cholesterol ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial in o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cla@@ dian and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study of preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the tempor@@ om@@ andi@@ b@@ ular area was reported , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zinc cit@@ ric acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental operations . &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area of a patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and in a placebo treated with placebo .
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on A@@ cla@@ sta hip frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh area by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic region one year after the third annual dose . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta to increase the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
&quot; bone mar@@ cation markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration . &quot;
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at the overall IO@@ P and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al at all times . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the overall level and 4,@@ 3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior compared to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone atri@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.6 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording to the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response from 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimin@@ atory period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances are unlikely to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabol@@ ised inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance - 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance . it was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney failure up to 35 ml / min without tin adaptation of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
&quot; since there is only limited data available for severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ) were given the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , administered in doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , findings which reflect the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance . &quot;
in rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of reduced serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
risk management plan The holder of approval for placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out the studies and additional activities to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance which are presented in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan of the adopted version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the approval application and all the following by the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human drug products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on the safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk im@@ itation ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone remo@@ del@@ ing takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by re@@ acting the bone remo@@ del@@ ing , thereby securing a normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used medicines , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and beverages , please make sure that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or care@@ gi@@ ver as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or care@@ gi@@ ver as in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss A@@ cla@@ sta , you will immediately get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please come to your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; fever , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling sensation , sensation of sensation , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , inflammation , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , skin redness , skin rash , skin redness , skin rash , irrit@@ ation , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ atine , tissue damage and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not cur@@ ative wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the mentioned side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or you may notice side effects not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ zy@@ mia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or i@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; even in patients with no apparent risks in addition to obesity , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other related persons are indicated that it is necessary to super@@ v@@ ise the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied , is believed that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
patients with obesity have been examined and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the un@@ desirable effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;

only slight symptoms were observed in a study in which a limited number of people were given disposable en@@ cores of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after a year for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg of 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) was achieved . &quot;
&quot; 9 weight reduction and other risk factors In the trials in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average tr@@ ash of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen by 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with an obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo .
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 m@@ g@@ - and placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; achieved after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ RS = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;

patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical analysis ( age spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data on the safety of adverse events that were not observed in clinical studies , but were n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human @-@ therapeutic range , were considered to be potentially relevant to clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , it may not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ylene was studied in triple therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the triple @-@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study evaluating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. a cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in the report on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with elevated output h@@ ep@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme values must be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is continued should be guided by the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters are present .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be obtained from fat deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred below the hem@@ odi@@ lution . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a presence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma was reported with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma but should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients report about disturbances of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment must be suspended ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the reduction in insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine during pregnancy , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not invaluable from this data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents over the thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the normal range were often compared to placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , followed by 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to function via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ dal ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was evident compared to the initial values .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically in@@ significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plastic matrix eri@@ de and the free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while decreased levels were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ s@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to receive either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies showed that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the or@@ ally application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination period of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys comp@@ lied with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the reduction in insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity , reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid have been investigated . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values .
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women was shown . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in clinical studies in which pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was compared to other oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics or placebo ( non @-@ active tablets ) , in women ( but not in men ) , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a higher number of bone frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels indicating that the blood sugar levels were lowered as much as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ ro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy , for example , can change hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adaptation is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dos@@ ages or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other drugs taken by them .

&quot; hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , however , may develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ trac@@ tive help person or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the entire operation time is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resor@@ ption .
a series of fis@@ sile ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human @-@ insul@@ ine molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle is removed from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not exceeding 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ her@@ ed in accordance with the instructions for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to ask for other drugs taken by them .

&quot; when you hold the injection needle upwards , press the push button in the direction of the arrow ( Figure D ) • While you keep the injection needle upwards , press the push button in the direction of the arrow ( Figure D ) • Now you have to stream a drop of insulin out of the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
• Set the closing cap to the pen again so that the number 0 stands opposite the metering mark ( Figure E ) • Check if the button is pressed completely .
&quot; if not , turn the cap , until the push button is completely pressed • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let horizontal . &quot;
&quot; if the button cannot move freely outside , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outward , while you turn the cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the cap right next to the dosing stamp • Please note the highest number you can see on the pressure button • If you have adjusted a wrong dose , simply turn the cap for@@ wards or backwards until you have adjusted the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , insulin is removed from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up again in such a way that the 0 of the metering brand is over .
&quot; after injection , make sure to press the button after injection , until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin . &quot;

&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Survey Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; : &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted when administered together with a range of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin produced quickly must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin that is long . &quot;
&quot; 3 In case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dose adaptation is required , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General illnesses and complaints at the place of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur . &quot;

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ously given Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) mortality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) .
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours , and the entire duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data are limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger crystals of urine which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take more medicines for the prevention of g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl on the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in the history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing ur@@ ic acid levels in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently available pla@@ iting node and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum persist@@ ence is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney failure , efficacy and safety were not yet fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing drugs , it may occur during the treatment start to an acute g@@ out attack , because by lowering the serum lake level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for example in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ on syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the fet@@ al procedure and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in tin was not conducted any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposition ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any dose adaptation for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other substance .
&quot; in a study involving volunteers 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily received an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed gest@@ ancies cannot be closed to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors found in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) side effects included in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies , no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open term extension studies In the open long term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , eye @-@ catching E@@ KG , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of breath , skin dis@@ color@@ ations , skin les@@ ions , kidney failure , kidney failure , kidney disease , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism and arises as part of the reaction sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month @-@ determined serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the serum lake level to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function limitation The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function limitation ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the clay , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out node until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at were dos@@ ci@@ proportional after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage drop in serum concentration levels was observed , provided this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ le binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ols , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ Glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool could be found as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the well known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function limitation After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ pu@@ gh classification ) liver function limitation changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were around 3 @-@ times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied with a decrease in elev@@ ating performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , about 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies , no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month @-@ determined serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data , which show that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , vom@@ iting ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) , and acid bur@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other ingredient , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow the guidelines carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after getting up the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract besides p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , should be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions such as est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tions , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to remove the medicine from symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients not taking the medicine correctly and / or following symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , gastro@@ - and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly contains bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
there are no data available that indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients undergoing ortho@@ don@@ tic surgery reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be taken after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
patients must therefore wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients but it was also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .
&quot; nevertheless , acceptance of serum @-@ calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosphor@@ us up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate of an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients having one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continue to be adher@@ ed to ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ ra frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption oc@@ clu@@ sion on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is present , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time using Adv@@ agra@@ ph since the prescribed dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus bottom mirrors should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated inspections of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation below Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained for the duration of the application to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust must be converted twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this change@@ over has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; in the case of adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recept@@ ors - although there is no clinical experience with advanced , pancre@@ atic and colon transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood vessels in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine intake and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ on to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case by means of blood @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ level levels should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ant , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that might change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and transplan@@ ted and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as a refrac@@ tory disease there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
&quot; in addition to proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t receivers and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was considered as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy to observe cham@@ ber@@ - or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ ble@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ yk@@ oti@@ ka , like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus as a result of the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal testing showed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effects on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ i of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the supporting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following the side effects are performed after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are frequently increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding on ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot;
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cells .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction zones in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ins ( such as Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ ph and 9@@ 0,@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplan@@ tation The effectiveness and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ ph and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advanced Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were deaths . &quot;

&quot; incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ m C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) occurred deaths . &quot;
&quot; published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily applied Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and colon transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 cases of transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies accounted for observations in large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in ob@@ liter@@ ans was observed in 21.@@ 7 % compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of the patho@@ genesis of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis is significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
a multi @-@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initiation dose ( via protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired level of water from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower starting doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , Ann @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ine value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;

advances are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether a lawyer is used to treat bleeding or to prevent ble@@ ed@@ ings in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling them to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of advances in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood leak@@ ages was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VI@@ II defici@@ encies , the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period is not to fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s finding , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereas the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ speed ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirr@@ ored in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) was detected by a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ac@@ tor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ umes its application for the marketing authorization of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , usually breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus can trigger no infection in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective protein found in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in brings benefits to patients in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not take the CH@@ MP to know if the recovery has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al nas@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms as well as the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed signs of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took off the lost property alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for placing Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity of combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ ose , l@@ is@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a s@@ wollen r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ al medication ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ al etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be suspended at least 48 hours before the der@@ mat@@ ological tests are carried out , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients could be detected , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not been identified yet , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the release of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dose @-@ study with adults , dis@@ missing 5 mg had no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause more symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients ran@@ ged from 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of an individual dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult volunteers , four test persons of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with the result of a dis@@ cord injury do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , the drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is present in this drug , may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach exit or the du@@ o@@ den@@ um ( intest@@ ine closure ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases may occur under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Hear@@ ing heart , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken drugs even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform@@ ing immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects not stated in this use information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , neck pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath not , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of eye @-@ catching h@@ ep@@ atic values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body util@@ ises the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom severity ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 , 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials of efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the hypo@@ aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the onset of symptoms and resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
&quot; in case of the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the term of allergy . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with the chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not enhanced by the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was indicated . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 m@@ g. showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the e@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , dis@@ infection results in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pren@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the incidence of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose case with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ clinical studies carried out with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with the lost lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ite , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ast@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher endurance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not enhanced by the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not harm the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced capacity impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pren@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study with the sy@@ rup formulation for children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , the recommended doses of the C@@ MA@@ x and C@@ MA@@ x in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ ding bottles with a child @-@ proof poly@@ propylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once daily in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets per day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study conducted up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs , and EC@@ G @-@ interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , a total of 5 mg had no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablet tablets put into the mouth once a day , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials of efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us melting tray proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to the decreasing formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in an individual dose @-@ study with adults , the result of a total dose of 5 mg had no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients however was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x by A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , while food T@@ max from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max from 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;

&quot; in single dose @-@ Cros@@ sover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk of local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze limited is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; infants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed to take no side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years of age . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable to the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that the C@@ MA@@ x and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. told the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ umes its application for the marketing authorization of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this tribe faster . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was cleaned , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs should be taken . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ cer@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infection and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was reinforced with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger viral load of four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are as well as as@@ cer@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ cer@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information is available at the time of authorisation for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ cer@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 m@@ g. of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ ral and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lagen content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be set in duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , to which drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ cial opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the elevated plasma level associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compensate for the degra@@ ded plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; 52 % degra@@ ded , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ cer@@ oses are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are present . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous use of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ factor ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may cause resor@@ ption of resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enz@@ ym@@ atic duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma level rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ e@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect distinctive increases in plasma levels while simultaneously administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while using as@@ cer@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ cases .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus dosage if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the introduction to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during the post @-@ seed period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , performed early and rarely used for treatment . &quot;
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied if they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of recurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and solid sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients performed under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ill@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ cial opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , species and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients receiving A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ esters with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % cell concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain level of resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which an Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ ad@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ lays / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ances mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a prescribed therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ fired A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 people infected with HIV at the age of 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had plasma @-@ HIV 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the use of &quot; un@@ fired &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI previously treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; at 50@@ 8 % , C@@ MA@@ X reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream to the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , hence A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that can be achieved on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas used in dos@@ ages , which were twice daily ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations were contained in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ cer@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 m@@ g. of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are present . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma level rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ ed@@ ron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the introduction to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a reduced body weight during the post @-@ seed period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ances mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ fired &quot; atri@@ ate should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas of male animals occurred in dos@@ ages , which were indic@@ ative of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation passages are not yet fully mature in young animals , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; &quot; was not covered either with PI pre@@ treated patients or patients treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 m@@ g. of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ lo@@ ids , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to intake in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be dropped in the long term , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s plasma concentrations were significantly higher after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl ben@@ zene contained in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the introduction to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during the post @-@ seed period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied if they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; early depar@@ tures of a prescribed 60 therapy are recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the use of &quot; un@@ fired &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI previously treated children . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream to the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , a fat l@@ ame on the stomach and other internal organs , breast enlargement and fatty tissue in the neck ( &quot; &quot; stit@@ ches &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate D@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected skin areas , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo performed either daily or five times a week .
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can continue for a long time until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination is 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is fully trac@@ ted . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur to circumc@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral areas , no clinical experience has been found so far . &quot;
&quot; though limited data suggest a higher rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or the hair@@ line was not studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause serious discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the retention or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although quanti@@ fiable levels of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were obtained neither after a one @-@ off or multi @-@ coloured topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most common and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of up@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include ail@@ ments at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ effects reported from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
&quot; side effects , which were reported from 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the test schedule , the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ foli@@ ation / ab@@ sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test schedule , the evaluation of the clinical signs showed that five times of weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe shr@@ ink@@ age and sal@@ v@@ age ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ adver@@ sely unique oral reception of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically serious side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a total healing of the up@@ war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment times .
&quot; the approved indications of external up@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) . &quot;
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed three times a week during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application for four months yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the cream @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the mentioned side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) are a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their life so far . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dentally contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . do not apply cream as your doctor has prescribed you . o If reactions occur at the treated area that prepare you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty in the recovery of the fores@@ kin can be expected . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medicine more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be carried out . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have applied other medicines or applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , as it is not known if I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over@@ comes into mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different with ris@@ war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to clean , dry skin with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully trac@@ ted . &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must retreat the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath it ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks in a row to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .
&quot; very common side effects ( expected in more than 1 of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( expected in less than 1 of 100 patients ) Very rare side effects ( in less than 1 of 1,000 patients ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin responds too strongly to treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more prone to infections ; it can cause a blue stain , or it can cause de@@ fl@@ ation . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects you significantly adver@@ sely affect or you notice side effects not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , these are lighter skin reactions which end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes to the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , shr@@ inking , skin irrit@@ ation , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat feeling or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a , inflammation of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a , irrit@@ ation , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , redness , face swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness , or shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme refle@@ x@@ ology in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complain , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its efficacy was measured ( by examining its effect in reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be disclosed and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. an authorization for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage intake can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ rot@@ ic ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical studies were predominantly in@@ fu@@ sions @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory delay and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe wa@@ ve@@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months after the treatment was started , and in the age of 5 patients with a severe form of disease usually occurred within one month to a serum version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ tra@@ itor ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with which it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ tainment . &quot;
patients with low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of an additional accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and vi@@ ability , which is presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the height of the children .
&quot; from 26 patients with an H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) achieved a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first four weeks a clear tr@@ ash of the G@@ AG mirror in urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; overall improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) could be observed . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Spiegel in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients one size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was to be determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a viable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; this register will include longer @-@ term security and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have performed a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken drugs , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
tips for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on body weight of the individual patient first the number of di@@ lu@@ ent can@@ ist@@ ers .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood lip@@ id changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thereby slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes much easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of operation in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ial cells , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta improved longer survival times than with the comparison drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. an authorization for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ cing bottle needs 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the n@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ - h@@ ating therapy @-@ cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ induc@@ tors or so - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no clu@@ e that in patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adap@@ tations exceeding the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et numbers of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia has been dis@@ regarded if pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( C@@ ret@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for whom treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should be prescribed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible impair@@ ment of reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ances ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life , such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; mixed @-@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised against the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is passed into mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed infant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ ial cells and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ ial cancer who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three single mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) in phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population since the pha@@ k@@ se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that may be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and mixed @-@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attack were occasionally reported in hospital studies involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were occasionally reported cases of co@@ eli@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal ) , intestinal inflammation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were sometimes reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
it has been reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ onia were reported in patients who were treated before or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important , fol@@ ate @-@ sensitive metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fold with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ ation ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ eri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the consequ@@ ent pi@@ vot@@ al enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only covered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural corneal end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ int arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a delay of pul@@ mon@@ ary function over time in the controller .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy confirmed medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival results in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination over gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medium P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = Dep@@ reci@@ ation interval ; IT@@ T = IT@@ T = current @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = value of the total population a statisti@@ cally Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with an overall confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sub@@ section limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te data ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients also required the application of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.1 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ors in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is returned in urine within 24 hours after application .

&quot; it is used by obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats attributed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg for taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el lab@@ yrinth , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stools , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of this drug must be adjusted .
it is recommended that additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures occur in order to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the dose of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ specified size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pass@@ able properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ b rest of the ga@@ str@@ otic and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ controlled diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;
&quot; risk management planning The holder of the approval for the placing on the market under@@ takes to conduct the studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities as described in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and thus to the agreement of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) of October 2008 , as well as all other updates of the R@@ MPs , which are agreed with the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP guidelines on risk management systems for human medicines , the updated R@@ MP must simultaneously be submitted to the next P@@ SU@@ R ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • If new information is available , the current safety guidelines , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities affect • within 60 days of enrich@@ ing an important milestone • on request of the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to new eating habits , begin before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
nutrition sta@@ di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat and how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
&quot; to ensure your ultimate weight , you should set two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
nour@@ ish yourself fatty acids to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see Section 4 ) . try to move more before you start taking the capsules .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects not stated in this use information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the treatment begins , since at this time you may not have significantly reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ induced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; avoid taking the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial bed@@ side , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Do not store drugs for children . • Do not store drugs anymore after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cardboard box . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is enclosed in this package .

&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
note the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , maintaining the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low @-@ physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you do not walk a little or at all , climb stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities daily . • &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Nutri@@ ent is a nutritional journal containing information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of additional information materials , which can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information for the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients receiving on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared with 69 % of patients receiving on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ t interval is extended , or which tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs tested against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ alen met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ i@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , do@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least potentially associated with Alo@@ xi were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in other dosage groups ; no dose @-@ active relationships were observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ oh@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of doc@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) received that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received on day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after finding clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ul@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % was measured between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous doses of 0,@@ 75 mg were comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time indication of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to lesser extent , are involved in the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions seen as adequate above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ul@@ arization , and pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is very low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like effective ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , and also the values of the liver enzyme al@@ in- am@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to form the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken ( i.e. no signs of the virus detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided by the E@@ MEA is . what were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to comment on the transport ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been stated that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease worsen@@ ed with more patients than in the reference drug drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to investigate the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with Kru@@ sten@@ osis ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or believed to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go does not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was reduced after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough to treat ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of the order .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued its approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ in o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started . &quot;
&quot; retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections , in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ in and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations achieved by humans after topical application on deported skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ON ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / stops or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have used al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the place of meeting was about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effect mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 % bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and pep@@ tide transfer centre .
binding at this binding point P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pep@@ tide transfer and block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
&quot; should the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ in at least some types of infection should appear , a consultation by experts should be sought . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ in compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on shiel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans according to topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 decreased skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies for oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro tests on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 cleared skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is sure that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be put to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix left one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
vacc@@ ines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a catch @-@ up vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ection@@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged between 12 and 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and toxic@@ ity on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % among the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 doses combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % of the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matching was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects who received the 3 doses combination vaccine . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines between 1 and 15 years of age , the serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was given significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full series of vacc@@ ines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study versus both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given simultaneously with the addition of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar serum and serum levels as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuff and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through swimming in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B Virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled dose of the second vaccine ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the vacc@@ ination series is completed .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . if you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your / her body defense , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child takes more medicines ( including those you may have without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ tious is not given pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ ent Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; ♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 deca@@ yed doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches , lack of appetite &quot;
&quot; ♦ very often ( up to 1 case per 10 deca@@ yed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , gastro@@ intestinal complaints &quot;
&quot; side effects which are rarely reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recorded doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally restricted or extended precip@@ itation , which can be it@@ ching or sw@@ inging , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like discomfort , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain conv@@ ul@@ sions , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ sen@@ sions such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have been known since issu@@ ance of the first authorization for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix has been in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with a complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ like en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ juice is - divided on several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ ias could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a fake medication , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle were effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia levels .
am@@ mon@@ aps were approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug was present .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life @-@ month ) , an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ tran@@ scar@@ ce .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium but@@ yl board , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred . &quot;
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental one @-@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine to acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
&quot; for example , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients suffering from the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat being produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ anti@@ st , and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in those patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ch@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in a so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with bladder dys@@ functions or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no en@@ during effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who have not yet swal@@ lowed tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ tran@@ scar@@ ce .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium but@@ yl but@@ yl rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium but@@ yl board , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) there were les@@ ions in the cor@@ tex cells of the cor@@ tex .
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; for instance , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ule form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium but@@ yl but@@ y@@ board . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accumulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken drugs even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine may pass into mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , rec@@ las@@ si@@ fication of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin odor , skin rash , kidney failure , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects not stated in this use information .
you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box and the container .

&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in the case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart sei@@ zur@@ es , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days and a year as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox with regards to all indicators was just as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox@@ ins may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other ingredient . &quot;
&quot; it should also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to acquire angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us indication of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further consequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs . &quot;
&quot; an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given immediately prior to the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous bol@@ us indication of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single angi@@ ox bolt has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to under 225 seconds , a second bolt will be of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before application and the dose can be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney failure ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg should be given and the ACT again to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• High sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if most of the blood vessels of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous kor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , in principle , bleeding may occur everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are inadequate in relation to the effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the retention or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine group and in the treatment groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of frequent adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i Meas@@ u@@ rements for severe bleeding such as in the foot notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood circulation loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ ops in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can immediately be broken down and the patient closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on bonding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turns out the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was diagnosed with serum from patients in which it was in the past to indu@@ ce he@@ par@@ ine @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mb@@ oses ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is showing a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a period of 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple @-@ end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in Table 10 . &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine as pep@@ tide passes a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from spl@@ itting the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence due to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 @-@ fa@@ ec@@ es of the clinical ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; side effects due to a longer @-@ term physiological strain in response to non @-@ home@@ opathic coag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to those in clinical use , even at very much higher dosage . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or to process insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot function insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any other ingredient , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which may affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is to be applied as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effective strength , the brand ( heart , N@@ PH , zinc delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pin the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ f@@ regulation can be weakened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the un@@ desirable effects of disease known from clinical studies are grouped , grouped according to system organs and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability of available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ bling , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If the injection site is continuously changed within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose injection by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ cos@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) , as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the effect duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic abnormal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male subjects ranging from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing area of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg and a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ escent effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin analog has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that a comparable post@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was used , a better post@@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin dose at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human standards , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
