<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as much as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripizzol is believed to be a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripizzol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, is used to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripizzol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing reoccurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol over twelve weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhale (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness compared to the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes with previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also effectively reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled shrinkage), fatigue (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were responding to the treatment with Aripizzol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with a lack of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients displaying mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripizzol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals used as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripizzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripizzol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no higher risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripizzol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleried and malign)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripizzol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"for this reason, Aripizzol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease (56 - 99 years) with Aripizzol, patients treated with the Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these trials, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events with Aripivzol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polygpsy, polyurea, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripizzol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripizzol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripizzol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripizzol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripizzol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common application of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be lifted to the dose-height prior to the beginning of the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripibozol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripizzol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripizzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data protection for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripizzol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripizzol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia appeared compared to patients treated with semi-operdol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripizzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripizzol was 15.1% in patients with oplanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripizol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-surgical treatment. "</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripizzol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripizol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripizzol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripizzol include the malign neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdosages with Aripizzol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without sequence of death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripizzol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose as Aripizzol has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripizzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonist action on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripizzol showed a high affinity for dopamine D and D3 receptor and a serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor, as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"intravenous emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, on the Nucleus caudatus and the putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripizzol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder's response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripizzol 77% and semi-operdol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asmine scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripizzol showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate, which was at 34% in the Aripizzol group and at 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripizzol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripizzol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripizzol showed a efficacy similar to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-operated in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or semi-operidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which were partly not associated with lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripizzol resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission during a stabilization period before randomisation, Aripizzol showed a superior response to the prevention of a bipolar remission, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripivzol, the N-Dealkyung is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripizzol in extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripizzol there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects were observed."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripizzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripizzol and Dehydro-Aripizzol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study for patients with different liver cirrhosis (child-pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripizzol and Dehydro-Aripizzol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal rinds in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripizzol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3times the middle Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripizzol, the concentrations found in the study of more than 39 weeks were found in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>
<seg id="99">"in rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11x the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose."</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether a lawyer is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleedings in surgical procedures.</seg>

<seg id="1534">"it is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling them to form the human coagulation factor VIII."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"Advate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, however, is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures."</seg>

<seg id="1540">"in March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1541">"dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiencies, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient."</seg>

<seg id="1639">"therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"in December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company resumes its application for the marketing authorization of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1641">"however, usually breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected."</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"the virus in advexin is a" "Adenovirus" "that has been changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus can trigger no infection in humans."</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">P53 protein produced from the non-defective protein found in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">"in the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share."</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal nasal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms as well as the constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed signs of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took off the lost property alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), oral dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease, including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension caused by stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>

<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without cutting, breaking or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to the alphamimetical activity of combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoose, lisydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which are peroral or nasal as a swollen rhinoceral medication (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazal etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">"patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or of palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be removed."</seg>

<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unfired Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 people infected with HIV at the age of 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies, Agenerase was used twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>

<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream to the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"while the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss."</seg>

<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no clue that in patients aged 65 years of age or over the age of 65 there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">"in clinical trials, in patients with a creatine-clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adaptations exceeding the dose adaptations recommended for all patients."</seg>

<seg id="2401">High doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in reduced Pemetremixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal renal function (creatinin clearances ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">"ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life, such as Piroxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed."</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are no data for use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been stated that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease worsened with more patients than in the reference drug drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with Krustenosis) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or believed to be caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo does not work against this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was reduced after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with Hautwunden, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough to treat abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo outweigh the risks in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued its approval to the company Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of retinapamicin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"retinapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections, in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinapamicin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations achieved by humans after topical application on deported skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin ON (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% retinapamulin Salbe."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamine is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breastfeeding continues / stops or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have used altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of meeting was about 1% of patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retinapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50% bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding and peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding at this binding point Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer and block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retinapamicin at least some types of infection should appear, a consultation by experts should be sought."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinapamicin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix left one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in six months and a 12-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonaps in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle were effectively prevented from high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps were approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug was present.</seg>
<seg id="2813">"the use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days)."</seg>

<seg id="2815">"for infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granule form."</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">"according to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults."</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithtranscarce.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium butyl board, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">"since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or to process insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisine differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot function insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin isper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisine or any other ingredient, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines, which may affect blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is to be applied as a subcutaneous injection, either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effective strength, the brand (heart, NPH, zinc delay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-Converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fluoroxetine, propoxyphene, propoxyphene and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympathic drugs such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpin the symptoms of adrenergic counterfregulation can be weakened or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisine occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"in the following, the undesirable effects of disease known from clinical studies are grouped, grouped according to system organs and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on availability of available data)."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous glucose injection by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucosine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscle and fat), as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver."</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the action occurs faster and the effect duration is shorter than with hu- manic abnormal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male subjects ranging from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin lulisine showed a proportional glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosing area of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg and a disproportionate increase in the glucosescent effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin analog has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
