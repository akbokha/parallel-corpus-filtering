&quot; the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras page . select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the entire URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ y@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations cannot make important decisions on the translation without checking the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily . &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings add extensions ... Open the card box tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available . &quot;
the module An@@ chor filters ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Acc@@ ept@@ ance filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M image of the currently displayed website . as default the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : the other node is sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles feature meaningful color and lab@@ eling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of ne@@ sting depth or mapping a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is present at all , only if there is enough room to display or if the area of child rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; as division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu item View stop at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you call the module image gallery , a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation panel to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the box file name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
display the file size of the image to see if the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
indicate whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can adjust with a slider or a turn panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original images to the gallery with the original pictures .
&quot; with the Comments box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be set here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane window or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane , and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser Det@@ ection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , adding that you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that den@@ ies access to this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E Brow@@ ser@@ detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Adju@@ st@@ ment , you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . the following tests can be carried out :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check out if your &amp; HTML ; document the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches , all found errors are displayed . with this check you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
&quot; allows you to review your &amp; CSS , style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a consistent appearance regardless of the browser used . &quot;
checks the links on your site to re@@ direc@@ ts and faulty links . recur@@ sively all links on the website are checked .
here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets .
with the module Web @-@ Archi@@ ver for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save websites with text and images in .@@ was format .
&quot; click on Tools page to archive the displayed page , and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , is digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to get involved , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the file name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considered every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden folders . you can do this by adding a point in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My stu@@ ds to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections R@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , is digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ cam . if the if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can store a picture in another part of the tree tree , over the horizontal separating line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped in keywords , data list or searches . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to make the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter will only work on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it displays the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ fes@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ utions or after the date on which the album was created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select the album properties menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections from the tool@@ bar collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort .
&quot; buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; when you first create an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As &apos; Album preview , &quot; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key word list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can re @-@ create all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the thumb@@ nail . what information is this , you can edit the edit settings ; change the Albums page here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appears . if you leave the mouse cursor a moment over a picture . the Help shows the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about what it is about &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to these . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing of images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select a guide how to edit your photos . using image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to adjust it to your needs when your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing other image processing programs , it may cause problems with the metadata that contains the image . some programs do not store these data with if you store the changed image . this will lose this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ lists quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with cat@@ ch@@ words provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos selected with this keyword will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . as a result , you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My cue @-@ bar quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My key quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ t@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting it in the context menu Key@@ word . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My key quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select as a Album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stab &quot; ; alternatively , you can also click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords attributed to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you just need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps , and more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here the search will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search does not find anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will be able to save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered in . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for the Advanced search will appear . here you will find more rules for searching . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search context menu . &quot;
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search@@ able . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here a sw@@ ell@@ tale can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally sets your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lighting table from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview panel , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window and place there . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited for sorting out of a series of images . if you use pair@@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right side . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal dele@@ tions work directly from the lighting table as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview images . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you must click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area in the preview mode . &quot;
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken until the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photographs performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at the method for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , review , archive , archive , archive , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Manager takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored according to your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; your image files have to be organized somehow on your computer . you have to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will have to switch to a larger drive some@@ day . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly find your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photographs , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the Met@@ adata option to be saved in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? add &amp; edit a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you , or it can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data show characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to just see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as many text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE also provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already drives with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be even more thrilling in the future . I &apos;m sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can view with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam should be deposited as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , it must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is a photo agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , plate failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , dis@@ belief &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; slowly start burning with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy study &quot;
&quot; in a nut@@ shell : dis@@ ks hold the longest if they operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temperature differences , the error rate increases dramatically . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ minent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices don &apos;t make much effort , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . in your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked keyboard , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable result that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the correctly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all peripher@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run down the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in power disrup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destinations for your software . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies , a backup and distributed memory is included in the offer . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they create inter@@ s@@ encies within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; hasn &apos;t been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are heading for the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . therefore , you often make your data subject to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ op@@ lanes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as said above , a frequent reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete protection and the last differential protection .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest with the exception that it is only abor@@ ted , and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfers r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
save important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or any other optical media .
&quot; at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file , retain IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original content , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ locate images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus , valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to let you know how the current system is backward . the fewer variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
&quot; this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change the open standards , which are supported by many applications . &quot;
&quot; virtualization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; var / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ides / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the call if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available which can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ screen format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and comm@@ ited to use metadata . a handful of camera cre@@ ators are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it sometime .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the &apos; 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers capture it from an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , archi@@ val . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again and edited , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photo to an album you can find a description , how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it off . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . in some cameras it can take a while . when the connection is made , a ready indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the chosen ones . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . these images have not been scann@@ ed until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folders sorted , displayed . then select the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edit ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Clear All Clear button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and then delete selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . therefore , you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully removed from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera smo@@ ker , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % M . to do so , turn on the option date &amp; time . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the side@@ bar metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . it refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you need to save this data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change the settings dialog . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on saved preview or start editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without losing .
&quot; save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the light@@ box by &amp; digi@@ kam , can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the lighting table , these settings are not available when possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar when you use image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images with the TI@@ FF files option . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF image . it does not affect the image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of digi@@ tis@@ ation , image processing was only one image viewer for photos . at present , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the green pixels of the CCD sensor are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights in the settings . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results as it shows the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the re@@ constructing option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it a bit higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo vo@@ icing small you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; according to some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable Number of Gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction since it is performed during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from one color space in the other to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible .
questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ t@@ apping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it &apos;s quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support many modules that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings , Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata one or , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left hand side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can indicate the dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections for del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be implic@@ itly by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the digi@@ ti@@ sed video screen ; when starting , it may accelerate the startup process . &quot;
&quot; the setting Up after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , query &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the item Display / Edi@@ ting .
image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the upper edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
editing functions of image editing will change your photos . none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save button or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the picture .
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with Save as File . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button or the button &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore the Image Processing &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last time . &quot;
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit back or restoring by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; pressing the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same cat@@ ch@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , down the image or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can move in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mou@@ se@@ wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can edit the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the dialog box . see this section for editing image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; C@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole phrases . you just have to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu Album Export Printing Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right margin , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab makes the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the edge again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label panel in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or just change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you choose a metadata settings that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with previously used keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the typ@@ ed keyword . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering key words in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate box in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears , asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on K@@ eine keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was selected and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created a rule and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already in the database .
&quot; for example , you can choose an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . then the options will look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable diver@@ gence from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web that correspond to those of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see more information below )
&quot; your only other image issues are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor can work on s@@ RGB , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; same : this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light bor@@ der@@ tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast extend : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited by working over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . so if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynamically adjust the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the right top a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures that most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
&quot; the pres@@ et button res@@ ets all the filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in another picture than your original . if you store these settings , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; mould color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when you put a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a combination of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colours are also a few photographers , especially those who have hardly any landscapes , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the power of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can view the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , an active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the regulator and observe how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image , and the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is rendered using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most useful . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic arrangement is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the upper@@ most for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output value : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output rate as in the input value . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input value applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is most useful . in this case , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a c@@ rank arrow to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is to see a red marker . if you post@@ p@@ one this mark on the area you want to change , a suitable line will be shown on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels . if you find over@@ exposed pixels in more than one channel , you get the combined result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
der &amp; digi@@ kam channel bl@@ ender ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you are activating the appropriate color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . colour space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any processor @-@ setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been reset . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

&quot; green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ ary scenes at the time of the day . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .

with the digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to one image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter set the desired type of frame for your image . trans@@ vers@@ ed the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ed effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them . &quot;
&quot; any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template apply you can put a template on a picture .
the Image template menu can be used in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the digi@@ cam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will update the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the Pre@@ view , you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
&quot; images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process paints with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , results in sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; for JPEG images , a camera has been used extensively . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image can re@@ focus the tool . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cra@@ ck@@ le . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu application Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ er and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ me from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values frequently generate good results and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or amount will increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will create . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount indicates the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus one can define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ ission @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
&quot; the bass cle@@ av@@ age has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase of correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness of the module .
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is Gau@@ ß &apos; . in most cases , you should set this value to zero to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are making changes that are not immediately visible , but leave behind unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp masks are producing better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ ens the sharp@@ ness of the range of the dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smooth regions smooth@@ ing and detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is needed afterwards . note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will generate a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , place this value appropriately to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ pac@@ ed da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it to release it .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected using Small Artef@@ akte . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the journey .
the red@@ ress reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny sound that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller mistakes cleaned . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front looking to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter frequency response . if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the color settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically mi@@ tig@@ ated more strongly . however , it also s@@ me@@ ars the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the phase j@@ itter@@ damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for reducing the noise you have placed can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie gra@@ ining , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG Arti@@ facts Re@@ duce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ formity Rau@@ schen . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious filming on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph that was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method , there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark@@ screen . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the dark image to the image that is to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; dur@@ ess : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ectable quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise blur@@ red effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color and gray depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that has been done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density the filter . the default density is 2.0 , giving an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gil@@ ance correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the image with these options . the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , you can set the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the second degree cover the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth degree revers@@ es the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geometric distortion .
&quot; in general , this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion four degrees . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and causes a correction of the first dig@@ its . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks .
brigh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . it is best to correct this correction than the first one . if you cut a picture and then perform a sound @-@ shaped correction the effect would seem obvious .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs like pictures from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film by G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for filming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Option Fun@@ ction film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known from classical high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny view specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images . smooth@@ es the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
&quot; the digi@@ cam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch yourself . these would be good pictures to start with . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the image is distorted in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art through blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; gentle bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
vibr@@ atory sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives you natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
&quot; you can choose with the digi@@ cam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that is to remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can use it by mirr@@ oring or rotating in the right direction . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ate was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; keep the aspect ratio preserved : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose , and each entry can be saved as a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create an image . image editing allows this very easy . to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by moving at the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The C@@ trl @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; cutting The tool After aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio scores its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are saved as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the combination assistance enable help to fade in , so that you can put together your images better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third spiral , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden centre is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the golden ratio is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to decorate your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos in order to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ hand gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be pla@@ ited a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the pres@@ ets knob you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Transform@@ ers tri@@ mming function from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally trim function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will move the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can flip horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sc@@ aling , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam , the file in image processing is displayed . you can modify this list of file extensions that is &amp; digi@@ kam . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read through Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . see Con@@ figuration section for more information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understand these formats and will preview for movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need to do the editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &quot; &quot; Tex@@ ture &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical split without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjustments from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally sets your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets stored by &amp; k@@ de may apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the pallet view . here , too , the color name can be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box With Add C@@ ursor under the button color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the copy , cut , and paste actions . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color choos@@ er on the left side .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are in view of the program author outdated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated and k@@ de program .

&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or select this position automatically with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphs viewer , can also remember your decision , so that later will be done as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the Settings k@@ graphs viewer , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside a current &amp; c@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page will be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a text distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Ref@@ res@@ h page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
opening the page gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; specify when a graph will open outside a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here , you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible , and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for unser@@ i@@ alized graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm generates a boun@@ cy model layout for unser@@ i@@ alized graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics and contains a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the Graph@@ ene file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can enter &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithm special options , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of the graph ( directed or non @-@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for selected graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help on this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source repository &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ graphs ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following packages :
&quot; a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs ; in the Settings menu , you can find further options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing dies , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; a new icon will be created . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch . &quot;
&quot; reco@@ vers the last step back . if you have not made any step backwards , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current symbol in shades of gray . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol range of &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it displays the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing surface , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialogue with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol screens . &quot;

&quot; select Transpar@@ ent Pixel or view Lin@@ e@@ ale and set in Uni@@ coloured : or a chess board as transparency display . you can also adjust for the ch@@ ess@@ board the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module contains images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by clicking on the default duc@@ er &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you click the button to read the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is displayed completely , otherwise some settings may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you cli@@ cked the button , wait until the scan is completed and the screen will display the image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 by saving the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after selected in the Import &gt; Screen ... menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ mod@@ alities :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
after the screen@@ shot has been made the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r is able to show its photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world that show photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication , so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser will be started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is launched for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords Field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as tags during the upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Family options , you can adjust the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos in front of the upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered with maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to obtain a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera position must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera position . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one place for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and placed with the shown map . to do so , select the respective region and increase si@@ e.@@ Exec@@ ute this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery where each image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ dex@@ show , &quot;
the Reiter album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder from which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programming messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor does not currently have a documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy to the main program and then call the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ ter Module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . then you can create the module using extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio section . there , you can also change sorting pictures and / or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the picture transition is fixed below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can use the button to start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the settings button on the right bottom . &quot;
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is useful for improving or printing directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : don &apos;t expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now reset the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them later on , you should not select the JPEG format since it allows only a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file into the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp to be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you have chosen . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; to remove images , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments . &quot;
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , comments on the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you want to have shown your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures on the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions via Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , because otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
&quot; selecting pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . therefore , it is not used the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect at every transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn in . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the lower left edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have comments on your pictures and videos , you can browse through &amp; photo@@ album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are entries in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have comments on your images and videos . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the entry with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the pictures shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to select which image to display for each individual . to do so , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be shown or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the search key in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like reading manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you want &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time start , or select the menu item Help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo@@ album ; try it . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name implies , this bar displays date statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be shown in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview screen . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drawing the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual it is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create through the menu File HTML ... to access .
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the review and a description , which will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page .
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . as a result , you can avoid that information is displayed that are visible to the viewer without a description . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not addressed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page , you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , which for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check whether these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , correctly , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current file , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and import .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or whether in the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can get all the pictures together and pass this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be scann@@ ed . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images can be described , which you can view through the menu File Ex@@ porting ... . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when you switch to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automati@@ cally to copy &amp; photo@@ album copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option on this page is Maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File ... select , will import &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database . that &apos;s why you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories to match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; you just have to be able to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and today it will take care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want it . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option -@@ c . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you will see the different settings in the following section of the user manual .
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
&quot; in the Options section , sub @-@ categories are already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ cam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface .
&quot; the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a support page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are used by several applications among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not working . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album must be photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category that you defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , it will do &amp; photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the module you want to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you get &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the image was taken . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these remarks by using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by defining people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always be using them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have a family celebration and you can see the same 5 @-@ 10 persons on all 50 pictures , you can find that the names are moved upwards , find and arrange the persons faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and comment on them . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry image in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or any pictures if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the preview preview . just select the appropriate images you want to delete , or select either the Rem@@ ove button or select in the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; photo@@ album ; namely images can also be used without having you stored on the hard drive . of course you have to store the images somewhere to record &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard drive . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support it until now , so please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those you may want to make for others and click on Current View lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , and lock the menu item Every@@ thing apart from current view . &quot;
&quot; you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to block images , so that all images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered for blocking images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it , of course , that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason features &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the pop @-@ up context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser will show you matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons on the left and the bottom . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the Min@@ us button , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out the zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key , the zoom takes place so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work in videos , that enter and zoom with the plus and zero key . &quot;
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment , you can look at it and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper developed . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad , while watching one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have defined features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the pictures you are editing , print , or whatever you have selected , then simply add all the images you want to copy to a CD , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you want to display categories in the preview screen , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can use &amp; photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way , you can undo your painted later . &quot;
in the picture you can click on the image from the pop @-@ up menu . to exit the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the Add @-@ in menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are many possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with dele@@ tion , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly to App@@ ly or Canc@@ el the Chan@@ ges with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can invoke the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points van@@ ish and a small cross is shown in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot;
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a available view , drag the tap to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the tap to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , you pull the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ card reader at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the tap onto the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left in the fas@@ cia bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene render , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you want , from a quick preview up to full @-@ quality images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to know the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
in the quality combination field you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , in order to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; and P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard , adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously split and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not made an object . &quot;
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ended you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the menu entry File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the Property View , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation on the displayed object . here you will find the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; and P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type features .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire @-@ model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window instructions section you will explain how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the Standard window arrangement sel@@ ector : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window curtains shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything error @-@ free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit Rem@@ ove menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved later , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you hit the App@@ ly button or press button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert End &apos;s Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then hit the App@@ ly button or the input key . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tab . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ment only shows a matte black material , because you have to type settings for the pigment yet . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the box and ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select the colors in the object tree and change the colors in the object properties view : &quot;
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , use a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , the ball will give a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first object and change the name , for example , in sphere of pigment . click sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter key .
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already show some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers you . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the Standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be chosen if you have used Edit back@@ tra@@ cker .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change the default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually , without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; in@@ feed show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; in@@ feed show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the return key .
&quot; you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field will appear in the right bottom corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the way of working of &amp; in@@ feed show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , button short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; in@@ feed show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ eh@@ ick@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; cu@@ dd@@ ler show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can configure &amp; in@@ feed show ; set up that only some of the file types will display which the program can also display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
speci@@ fies if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation by &amp; ku@@ n show , in the card cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
shows big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the digi@@ cam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the fact that the user contributes its part , at least issues and potential improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . &quot;
&quot; it is a project that is supported by a community . that is , users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings show@@ photo ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you are supposed to indicate in contrast . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . the same page bar is also available in image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s : &quot;
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images that do not make more than images and save images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images prior to saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command gu@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed drivers . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ anen ) does not particularly treat these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire preview into the window . &quot;
when the image has been selected the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings button , the dialog box is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview has to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type of &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; morph@@ l@@ ite ; to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to store it . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the knob About starts the K@@ DE Over -@@ Dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the knob Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .
&quot; &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; licensed under the GP@@ L , and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global key short@@ cuts by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting the Global button short@@ cut . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
start require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . if a script is started then Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is su@@ cked . the script could now query the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ate , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks Script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should design@@ ate your script packages right away .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
when your script package is finished you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and app@@ end the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection @-@ browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have a few play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re @-@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to type the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; there &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; de@@ bu@@ gging symbols enabled . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has multiple cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; the player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed . &quot;
use m@@ oods bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le , thereby changing the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; store mood files with music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , are used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece , so that the play@@ lists window will pop up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when switching to context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn fonts , the otherwise gray set will be enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the qu@@ al of choice and can define your own color scheme . &quot;
&quot; re@@ play while starting , ensures that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece in place with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD @-@ colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color sel@@ ector . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which is &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting , as should be done with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the checked and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : make that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box Driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is another installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . thereafter , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use the username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar performers to the played piece can be viewed . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will make trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it &apos;s because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3.3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; error when writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3.3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / recur@@ rence / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest with the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers , using the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if you have something about fixing a defect in Amar@@ ok yourself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively maintain the interface , the start sub@@ window was converted to the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate tracks , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it drop , just like you would make it with other files . so simple it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the addition button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config utility . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you will also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 jack , En@@ ter key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in finding the problem matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another S@@ ink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next item of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ ge the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the command register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute command stops again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good .
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press it on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tricky features , but what about the icon in the Control bar system section ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can &apos;t be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ site , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and clicking on F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release schedule that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the Add Amar@@ ok button .
the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ low@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably it became &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and re@@ install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ des &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed in addition to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; in Settings Amar@@ ok setting up ... Audio output will give you the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , and output will be done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not taken care of . of course you can take this problem into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tainer for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very simple . move with the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection facilitates the search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . you can find this button in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . to do so , click Add to the tool@@ bar . if you have a playlist in the folders of your collection , then you are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select the Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have various possibilities to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the upper edge of the window , there is a scroll display showing the current piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sample rate of the current play . click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons also feature the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position slider . use the slider to set the play position or adjust the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you tick the E@@ Q button , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; you can divide the playlist window into two main areas , on the left hand side the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t@@ ation@@ . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its review . &quot;
&quot; to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
under the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
&quot; you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual fields to start playing right away . you can also click the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the pop @-@ up menu .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can select which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group Interpre@@ t - grouped only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Artist / Year - album - sorted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are sorted by genre and then sorted by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; a selection box is located under the search filter , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - this emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; on Media Player , transfer the pieces into the queue for transmission to the media player . for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) move files to the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Mark@@ s the selected album as a compilation , and after that it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; list Mark@@ ing - Chan@@ ges an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer listed under Mis@@ cell@@ aneous interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter , sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not meet your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . for example , if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : as a result , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter the letter , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all keywords . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries , one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also look for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher score than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some search for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; for example , Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher score than 50 , and not include the comment bath . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then be lab@@ elled with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side you will find the addition you can add to the playlist . to the right , you can save play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , magni@@ fici@@ able analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that , which you will see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting action cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays are played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist , or use the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the sequence of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ low@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them into the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select load . thus , your current playlist is replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly re@@ plen@@ ish your playlist , and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists receive a blank playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded items will be added at the next batch conversion , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
the New Ref@@ er button brings new pieces to the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
&quot; right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit , and the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
enter any name for the playlist here . however the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while respecting the settings . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog , in which a script package will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also install new scripts from the Internet . to do so , use the More scripts button . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see the writing scripts section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you rel@@ o@@ ad to MP3 , you can get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open source of patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without normal@@ y , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced in different ways . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project not stored , what should happen , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects and ended &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above what is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful if you need files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; this also allows you to create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the copying / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying is not supported , so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the contents to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the pressing button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window appears after reading a DVD in the Content View , but can also be used single @-@ standing . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and locks of the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for viewing audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system manager rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on th@@ ief , this dialog is designed for custom@@ ization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the d@@ co@@ p &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the included programs will give you preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to be able to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format@@ d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String Guit@@ ar ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Directory ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String result ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ ce / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be recorded audio CD ; s are read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ing@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as mentioned before , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily usage to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the user interface &apos;s slim approach , which you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network where everything is collected manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . step by step further information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B requests the CD data according to the establishment of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup program - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the File Manager , so that an already loaded file will be selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ sis ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main direction dialog by &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important , as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex tracks of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio about 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or by the program automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the title to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from downloading information publicly available on CD ; more or less useless , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( Send an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used by the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed . &quot;
check whether you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; to read out . check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 key words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them for any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work , or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , you can also view the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card general settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet .
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is changed with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices need to be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . des@@ elect the first check box should be enough . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check out the CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ ned to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to encoding more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD , which runs on the hard disk . we will create and set MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is set up in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; file data manually instead of removing them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this is only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; just choose an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; agrees . in this example , this is not important since we do not submit the CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking the button selection of the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read just on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error message if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece &apos;s reading .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding is parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre@@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at persons who compile from source files and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
who reads this probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to add or modify something useful , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some properties with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting , also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for CI@@ S cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
&quot; if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose to open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after each other . )
&quot; once &amp; mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the items in the menu settings and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played back to the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu Collection at the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then selecting the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original ones at the beginning .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the collection manager in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it needs to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , you can select the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ determined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the Pre@@ vious piece button , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have just one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . but the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; another key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section is beginning ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can record a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( rif@@ le shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . &quot;
you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to display sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the included Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , do this in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name Name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option may be useful in order to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM prefers that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , you see which sounds are played right now . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer illumin@@ ates green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view the View menu under the View Channel View : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to solve the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; desk a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ M@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ M@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to get a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or , if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be listed under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to stress that I am just about to program@@ mer because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high with AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thank you Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also for all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error correction directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , check out The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you find an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category , and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / apps categories can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category to select from the View menu and next edit mode . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the menu and either select the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be inserted into the special em@@ bed field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to allow the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ ered c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; it can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device must be used and the TV channels must be configured . this can be used to manually edit the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally the sources are used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources . at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , external source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely necessary to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts slowly but why every time my CPU has to be tested for its performance ?
&quot; note : the response is over@@ hau@@ led k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used for comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional application application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used for the installation .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages by &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the Ki@@ le ; web page should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , or if you want to compile , or if you want to add extensions , this should be addressed to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management must be called . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn about its options the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( utter lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here just a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to control &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
quick @-@ entry assistant to &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a convenient function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of options for creating the document . some settings related to the document can also be made .
&quot; document classes : this is the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; scroll &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; stre@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with the German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see gray areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic execution of the settings , a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the most frequent and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex , the retri@@ eval search can be very helpful . once a DVI file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a single click with the middle mouse button in the DVI file ; -@@ Viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the DVI file , the elements of the DVI file are linked to the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other involved .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings . &quot;
quick Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be extended to &quot; &quot; on &quot; , &quot; and no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be found . the selection fields were developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the further selection box is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , image , or other element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file goes to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for setting the font size . it can be set the fonts for the main text , the notes , etc . there are the following fonts available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the script . if the font file is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the menu construction or the push of a button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , the logging should be followed automatically . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the letter e 12 is created , and only a few sets should have another scrip@@ ture . &quot;
the changes are merely taken within the environment ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the reading ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub @-@ sub@@ missions , etc . , can be added either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is used for ital@@ ics , until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ ratio : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; . &quot;
&quot; once the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem is used to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex , for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar enables the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin in different formats using the kno@@ bs in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - Bin@@ ding files . to do this only Modern under Settings box must be set up ... Tools Building balanced .
&quot; to execute the preview search , the cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on preview search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then executed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a single click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using quick @-@ mounting of the &amp; DVI file , an error can exist . should an error occur , it will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file explains the source of errors in the source text . in the editor , the bab@@ es of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the latest La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always returns the line in which the error appears . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; box ; jumps to the incorrect line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section . &quot;
&quot; frequently users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... settings General can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps have to be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the default one . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; kate ; used as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and forth from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings are made directly from &amp; box ; can be made out in the menu Tools .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn its options the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference which can be called La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as its syntax .
double @-@ click with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source code and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can also capture additional jumping brands . this is a unique type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding key individual allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump @-@ mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically switched on when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent options , were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code added . &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a zip line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; kate ; offers key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster result . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit paragra@@ phs .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit surroundings for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when you input many ne@@ sted environment commands , you can quickly lose the over@@ look . this command will close the most recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; and Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ling clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the braces of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted groups braces , the over@@ views can be lost quickly . this command completes the most recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple instructions are used as a seal . for the purpose implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two closing arguments for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic insertion of the double ignition signs can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. n@@ up@@ un@@ german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; shift Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a new@@ line but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; close within a table environment , close the current line with \ \ \ \ with a complete line change . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . while holding Shift ; Alt ; amp ; tries &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying row . although this tab is not the added tab , add to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code compensation , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three according to need and the other two are for automatic compensation . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box ... can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; the last letter of entry will be removed while pressing the back button . on the other hand , the list can be sc@@ aled down by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when choosing a command . alternatively , you can also jump from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump marks are possible and the desired parameters can then be frozen . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can be adjusted to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as guar@@ dians of general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . you always need to enter a few letters with \ \ begin , and the inv@@ oc@@ ation mode is used to provide a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the settings are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the fully util@@ ised environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ space @-@ related environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically gre@@ ased and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient conditions can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be incorporated . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; capable of adjusting the settings to these lists . this mode uses the default value for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex , commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file is used , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word den@@ oting mode is introduced over the menu editor C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot;
&quot; large blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many more people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the compensation for all already written wishes . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be completely shut down . here , the tres@@ hold for the display of the fully @-@ filled adjustment can be set . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; in order to view the basics to graphic formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for changing and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be converted and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are grouped in group @-@ wise in the menu Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the button root Alt ; 2 , via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Buil@@ d command , a viewer is normally called upon to compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project is funded by the project New Project .... In this way the following information will be asked for the project :
&quot; when running the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows for exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed on scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly well @-@ designed system where the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; text live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a full refund of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or keyword boxes . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ qui@@ er and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac , with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; much thanks to those who strive for the advancement of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; K@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; K@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . thus you get a signature ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save , or click the disk icon Save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails in private or professional , there are always enough signatures . &quot;

the most part of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is captured and shown either in the stage manager ... Dialog or in the &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the de@@ bu@@ gging menu , whereby the stage @-@ management tool is most important . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a step @-@ by @-@ step menu in the menu , a dialog for the selection of the running speed is displayed . &quot;
&quot; to stop the exp@@ ir@@ ation , press the W key or select step by step in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to create a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System ID ... in the menu and enter the value to search for in the dialog shown . &quot;
&quot; to follow a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the value to search for in the dialog shown . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source code in the pop @-@ up dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; source files included by the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or its si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking a source entry in the shown list puts the text poin@@ ter in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s Insp@@ ection ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source code in the pop @-@ up dialog . &quot;
&quot; all templates found are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; apply . therefore , multiple templates can be present with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template entry in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g inspec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared .
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog box below . if a variable has a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter will be moved to the corresponding line of this file in the main window . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit and give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the wei@@ ghted working folder , then leave the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to output on the screen , its file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let &apos;s delete the current file . if not , delete the current file and select the file to be reviewed by means of other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then let current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start using the Edit plu@@ gins menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage and add all included plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to one another . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more detailed information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be drawing the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to insert notes is simple . either the note entry is selected from the Editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project managers , the respective area or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends across a number of pages that are dealt with one another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; size / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close Tags : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not automatically close optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for ordinary tags . &quot;
&quot; update start and completion day automatically : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during insertion .
&quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the def@@ aults can be restored . &quot;
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or other files than with file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be stab@@ bed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created periodi@@ cally backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ back ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is per@@ ched through changes of M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ ks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the indication of warnings by means of hooks of no more questions .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; you can specify the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be applied for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid , divided . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the following should be specified when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in : &quot;
address : the path to plugin if it is not located at a location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
download component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . des@@ elect enables saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
currently only one plug @-@ in is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug query . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , and if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next , as if there is no current . &quot;
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help them better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities like car completion and node spaces . their simplicity and flexibility makes for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders include two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic lists of image buttons ( above the editor window ) , which insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Properties dialog . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow rapid insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type above itself nothing else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; An argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
inserts a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a section name and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute value of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each item ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in dialog once ( e.g. one for each item ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is an element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but be careful and &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check takes place only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; default &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Change 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . clicking New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; button abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with one , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script to find in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be received on the default input . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written on the standard output . it can be specified , what is to be done with the output specified on the standard output , by setting the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan its use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit tag &quot; &quot; when available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the promotion better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics and other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to complement the tool@@ bar or it should be shared with a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog using Settings tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository , whether someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , let &apos;s leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = session 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = inde@@ x.@@ html editing Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # in Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but be careful and &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files being replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be verified and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you may need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to launch the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , can be adapted . it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bar to actions , everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system are available . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars .
project related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ it the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please note in , and for more detailed information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all boxes , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marking or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area leads to a further context menu on the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string under the mouse cursor is a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , for example , &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu shown . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens . &quot;
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site to be downloaded , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two box riders at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other one !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while striving to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to work with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up @-@ language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details about the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window , or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
the problem re@@ porter is switched on and switched on at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , managed by the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved using settings actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be removed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu option in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . click on an activated plu@@ gins de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the desired version ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
activ@@ ates the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; edit the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which ones and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the mouse cursor environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be terminated with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled out automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , one , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , it is not possible to attach hooks . &quot;
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , will be excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the Pro@@ files window pane , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , making a separate tree view available for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub @-@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub @-@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a particular event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
by default it opens and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour cannot be affected at this time .
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be hidden to prevent removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk save option is not included .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and fs . &quot;
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with whom one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be easily st@@ owed above the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set using either context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which can be used to ren@@ ame tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool@@ bar , or set tool@@ bars , where it can be specified which actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bar ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each submission prior to use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are placed in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted over and over again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select file As template save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File as template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or inser@@ ting via the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files tree view , you can click a folder on the right and select Site template to enter a name for the template and secure . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ p he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder is set in such a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ building . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , allowing to copy content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the right head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to indicate right mouse button click ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; sourc@@ ec@@ ode editor which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source editor when needed , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ r of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke moves the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is retained . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL , editor and the source text editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta .... Accor@@ ding to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in general , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the website . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . this is used to create a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to modify the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is as usual in a text processing , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting or removing the button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way as the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the Table Wiz@@ ard or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists have to be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet design can be followed .
&quot; to be able to compile successfully , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present with a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and be activated later . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l the following entry is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a Pre @-@ age called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP &apos;s template that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each pass .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merging . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white marks . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merging :
&quot; if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; folder 2 folder 1 folder , folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder &quot;
&quot; open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; by selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merging of folders will be started . if a file is selected for A , but a folder for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the match .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you just need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and insertion of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected one can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files , which is to be seen in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ar &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be resolved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merging or manual editing no more row is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; text &amp; lt ; conflict resolution , but appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing options or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side up , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the section merging and editing edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you have to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is checked , it will automatically copy the clip@@ board and manually copy it . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; new@@ line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c letters . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically places an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white notes . &quot;
&quot; search inten@@ sely for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed on . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation , see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
changing this option does not apply to the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; on the selection fields for the encoding , a short reference appears what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window side by side or overl@@ apping each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge then the name of the last output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor which comp@@ lies exactly your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ fix for line synchronization to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in upper@@ case letters .

&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details otherwise . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line sequence pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without really performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking the + / - , or double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered as identical , if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . when folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not a : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist the merge cannot be started .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged , and the new file is selected instead of merge ( unsure ) enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; while merging , a file will be processed after another . the status column shows finished when the merge has been successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merging mode C will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merging , B is chosen as the target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge to start / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut key ) . to merge only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid merging actions through conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the faulty items . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options through , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter an error , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : when the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is turned on , a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes ) . &quot;
&quot; ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; enable synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been altered too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merging view stays visible in the merging of single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset , and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : new &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ one or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose is currently as a difference @-@ in viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 click the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then de@@ cap@@ tures &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name &quot; &quot; K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 &quot; &quot; are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or let him go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is a but this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice each difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit large amounts of text another editor should be used .
&quot; after removal of text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean , and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ ra@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of this . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and thus also not in destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version ) . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within a desktop as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to another .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , click the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it crosses with name ads , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classical lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and shift windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and setting up sel@@ ector switch ... allows dialog settings to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ z. If you do not have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to include a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you want &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image displayed in the magni@@ fier window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , it enlar@@ ges &amp; likes ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can use &amp; K@@ mag , causing a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save into a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to add it to other applications later ) , rotate the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button Document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Com@@ peti@@ tions &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to do this , use an area of the screen , so as you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;

&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter has remained in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and pain in every mouse click . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter suffers a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and em@@ ulate pain at any mouse click . however , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your mouse , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for each . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button emul@@ ates . move now the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must be stored after the mouse movement has ended , before the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will execute a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Fast@@ ening is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place . &quot;
&quot; this function is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ plan@@ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ plan@@ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can drag &amp; k@@ de ; to do this , you can reduce the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s last press . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; at first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be very clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or a f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you will execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , you can &apos;t park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to perform a keyboard input . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the tit@@ le@@ es of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to select text , copy it into the clip@@ board and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use it . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick on each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button will press down a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when moving the smart move . later , you can use the smart move even without the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is per@@ sever@@ ed . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and pain @-@ causing pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to begin a certain period of time waiting for a pulling process , before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialo@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages books you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you will define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a follow @-@ up memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; if you have done k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... Open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ pass page and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text forwarded to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed unchanged as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ap@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently under development in the SV@@ N . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; the selected text passage is directly spoken in the input field , and the selected text passage will be entered in the input field with the selection of In the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down panel of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book script will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book diary is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ gers page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; document the frequency of each word . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add promotions , such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either access the menu bar , tool@@ bar , or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation store . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation repository . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation repository . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by mou@@ sec@@ lick on the sh@@ aded left side and dra@@ gging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; K@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is by default arranged above the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by mou@@ sec@@ lick on the sh@@ aded left side and dra@@ gging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the voice output correct or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command on the voice output file . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ aks folder . then , the voice output is possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to de@@ compose the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - Continu@@ e language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the language generator is set up only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk to print text by the computer . it will store a list of already spoken phrases , which the user can always get re@@ printed . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; don &apos;t include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on your computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text over the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor and posters ; , even though &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done using speech dispat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .
&quot; in UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application with no visible window , the T@@ TS services over &amp; d@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set kt@@ ts@@ d above kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de interface . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program speech dispat@@ cher and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General is displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that vary in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , as the speed dis@@ pat@@ ter program uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card reader in kt@@ z@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already arranged narr@@ ators appear in this list . the most preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of mood here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the box General and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text orders , click on the map job to create and manage text orders . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field of voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears on the control panel when pre @-@ reading , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start , break , pause , pause , and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the box ; read the clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read , and select the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text shown . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read , and select the main menu Tools text . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; quotes ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system by &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events you have specified . you can also read &amp; t@@ ts the text of these messages . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up a message that appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before being sent to the speech dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of Screen Reader is read the stopped orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of the warning .
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a website , you can welcome anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of order are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads it , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined strings of strings , such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have adjusted a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text continues to be added to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the below setup dialo@@ gs will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the name of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Gener@@ ate . the list is executed from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete it . download a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string removal filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box do apply filter if identical . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character removal filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package &quot; &quot; deu@@ ti@@ ls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can , for example , specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text sent to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics , which the program pres@@ ides , sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it by clicking the button to get help during input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog of Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must register at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services through the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ port of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . first run kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you need to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so all pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing b@@ f@@ eit is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the right value for the respective language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the site of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; speech synthes@@ izer &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including package k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ an or downloaded each night currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script of the SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ pat@@ ters is possible , and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or sub@@ stitution , repeat , pause or cancel output . &quot;
&quot; if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have established a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will automatically be the best suited speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Fol@@ der on the Add @-@ in menu and add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map of the speaker facility will be displayed . for example , the module for the Inter@@ active module will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically carried out . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slider controls allow you to adjust volume , speech rate and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be changed . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can pre @-@ press items in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaker speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds to about half and 200 free ; % about the double normal speech speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to figure out what device is working with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader edition has been read the stopped orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can still welcome anyone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expense of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card message noti@@ fications appear . &quot;
tick this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played are written by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which will be displayed as the top entry in the list on the map . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;

&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for al@@ erts to a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice , speech rate , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds cut text into individual sentences . thus , &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading begin , since only the first set needs to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of pro@@ posi@@ tional filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . check the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; then start faster with reading , since only the first sentence needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of bor@@ der@@ no detection filters is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
set @-@ up filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and insert a tabl@@ ature sign ( Dez@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ up filter keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of bor@@ der@@ bor@@ der@@ no filters , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the map menu sel@@ ector sel@@ ector , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
&quot; if you do not er@@ ase or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who most likely corresponds to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here , select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in publishing the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the features in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker , and then use the speaker , which follows the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get any trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it has been terminated . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , preventing the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ z@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / resume the new voice . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; there is a setting speed on the card card . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be plu@@ gged into the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaker speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( that &apos;s because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ izing filter , and set up the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber does the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string release filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set before or reset . on the cart@@ on track orders will be displayed , the order consist only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; do not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by calling in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts in the audio output associated with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another one . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speaker speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; download &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) downloaded , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or created at least only on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from the sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ ki@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / zip / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit@@ - ) encoding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore you are looking for festival to be the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer , then the Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional w@@ rap@@ pers code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . it is required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this process uses special code to give the language over festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a matching folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed at this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore select Fl@@ ite as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ones . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthesis is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least a German language file from the MB@@ RO@@ LA file and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust only the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map speaker , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ phi@@ c speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; that means you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can &apos;t adjust pitch , volume or speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; preferably use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu &apos;s contro@@ l@@ centre ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; K@@ contro@@ l@@ centre will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Network Hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers must have been installed and configured function@@ ally so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device shows at all and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and rel@@ a@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by marking the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be permanently hit . when setting up the network settings , this selection is automatically pres@@ et . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you will be able to access the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab network interfaces serve to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der network interfaces :
the settings shown on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to set up the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Man@@ ually , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as characteristics of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be enabled or disabled as needed . switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be enabled or disabled as needed . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Name Servers dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list . &quot;
select an entry from the batch machine to the name resolution and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be displayed .
&quot; the list named above describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of names known by name includes some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar host and click the Add button . if the familiar host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a particular familiar computer from the list and select Edit .... Edit your scann@@ ed computer will be displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t und &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated using TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found a big distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is able to use a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the power address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed in case of DSL connections , so it is not surprising that in case of active DSL connections there is another content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs based on a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear to all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . &quot;
&quot; if the task is disabled , program name and parameter are not shown and the description will be disabled . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables appearing here set aside the otherwise existing environment variables for all of the tasks listed , except for force . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the Tas@@ ks folder . then go to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click the Tas@@ ks folder with the right mouse button and press C@@ trl ; N in the pop @-@ up context menu . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be started . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Select ... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you select both Mon@@ at@@ Day ( s ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be executed both at a suitable date and on a suitable day of the week . for example , if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the chosen months , regardless of the date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the c@@ ron@@ tab is saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to Edi@@ ting Cut . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select exc@@ ision , or press C@@ trl ; X . &quot;

&quot; the first was to create a surface for tar , which in addition provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer does it take when one sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat , which can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; train the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat , speci@@ fying by a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger . &quot;
before a tape of &amp; dat ; can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires a format@@ ting of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and capacity , &amp; dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape , all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save Report menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog for backup opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ connect , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are stored , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; locking the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the volume is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the string ID . the format of this string is the file name : seconds , the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open . if this is not shown , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably not with system manager rights . the protocol files are usually not found in the / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after typ@@ ed strings . to do this , enter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you will see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to see the important log lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol @-@ lines of level indication . the color representation of log lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can switch to new lines from the main window context menu to view all the new incoming log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program starts at startup of the system in the &amp; Linux world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not comment on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it is removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when changing to another run@@ level . however , system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial range :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have changed something , you can repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level , which only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running levels or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new range . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again attempt to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the various work ranges ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another running level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the font number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard running levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ opening . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply terminated without notice , if their configuration files are not present or incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation by &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after making changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two box cards , the user and user groups list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ card restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the card file password management appears , if shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD hub@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this map file only appears if space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space restrictions each in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set for each file system individually . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restriction .
&quot; the card card groups are informed about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group select this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
