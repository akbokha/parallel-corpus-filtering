<seg id="64">"you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the file name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk will be saved. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder. & digikam; considered every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="68">"you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden folders. you can do this by adding a point in front of the subfolder name."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My studs to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Rh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, is digitized."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission.</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. gPhoto2 supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digicam. if the if support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the side strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can store a picture in another part of the tree tree, over the horizontal separating line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped in keywords, data list or searches."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to make the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter will only work on the filename only if it displays the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlifesquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenevolutions or after the date on which the album was created."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select the album properties menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete new collections from the toolbar collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons Elders, Average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first create an album in & digikam, the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As' Album preview," select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol. "</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key word list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections always include all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the picture window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you can re-create all thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image will be displayed below the thumbnail. what information is this, you can edit the edit settings; change the Albums page here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window that appears. if you leave the mouse cursor a moment over a picture. the Help shows the most important features including all tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">"photos are all about what it is about & digikam; works. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to these. you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing of images."</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... Select a guide how to edit your photos. using image editing you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">"it may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button, and how to adjust it to your needs when your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"you should note that after editing other image processing programs, it may cause problems with the metadata that contains the image. some programs do not store these data with if you store the changed image. this will lose this information from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc."</seg>

<seg id="108">"if you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="109">"photos with catchwords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword is assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search."</seg>
<seg id="110">"when a keyword is selected, all photos selected with this keyword will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. as a result, you can organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My cue-bar quot; so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is stored according to your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer to find a certain photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely do not use & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"your image files have to be organized somehow on your computer. you have to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. note that you will have to switch to a larger drive someday."</seg>
<seg id="151">"maybe you'll be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly find your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photographs, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>

<seg id="214">Today's cameras are heading for the 10 megapixel sensors. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">"you get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. therefore, you often make your data subject to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing disks."</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open-screen format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commited to use metadata. a handful of camera creators are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the '90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers capture it from an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, archival. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correct Automatic correction try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values across the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light bordertones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited by working over a colour space with 8-bit per colour. so if you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the right top a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures that most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the preset button resets all the filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in another picture than your original. if you store these settings, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digitised; mould color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when you put a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquoth; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a combination of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers. Velvia's strongly saturated colours are also a few photographers, especially those who have hardly any landscapes, too much. "</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the power of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can view the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, an active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the regulator and observe how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, and the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is rendered using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most useful. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic arrangement is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the uppermost for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called Gammaxes."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output value: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change the output rate as in the input value. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process paints with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, results in sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"for JPEG images, a camera has been used extensively. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image can refocus the tool. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image can refocus the tool. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crackle. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu application Correct softener and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove slime from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values frequently generate good results and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or amount will increase the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will create."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount indicates the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus one can define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharper and therefore beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfission-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the bass cleavage has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is Gauß '. in most cases, you should set this value to zero to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauze sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are making changes that are not immediately visible, but leave behind unpleasant artefacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masks are producing better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothens the sharpness of the range of the darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smooth regions smoothing and detail. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is needed afterwards. note that the detail conservation should always be subordinated to the direction of direction."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will generate a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artifacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, place this value appropriately to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-paced da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. therefore we recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected using Small Artefakte. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the journey.</seg>
<seg id="530">The redress reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller mistakes cleaned."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch to the front looking to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the filter frequency response. if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change colour or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the color settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically mitigated more strongly. however, it also smears the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of the phase jitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius reacts to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for reducing the noise you have placed can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">The solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the softer with the menu entry Correct softeners and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, movie graining, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitized images."</seg>

<seg id="548">"JPEG Artifacts Reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>

<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise blurred effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the wide exposure ranges of today's film and color and gray depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that has been done without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size modifies a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflate was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"keep the aspect ratio preserved: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed."</seg>

<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create an image. image editing allows this very easy. to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and tightening the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by moving at the corners of the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Ctrl-button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X)."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"cutting The tool After aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio scores its settings depending on the orientation orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are saved as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the combination assistance enable help to fade in, so that you can put together your images better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third spiral, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden centre is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden ratio is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to decorate your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos in order to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you assemble a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-hand gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can be plaited a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the presets knob you can set the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transformers trimming function from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically trim function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming cropping from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear, for example, will move the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can flip horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you press on presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the scaling, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cropping from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not addressed specifically."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page, you can set up different resolutions for the images. this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, which for example have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="928">"once you have created your images, you can check whether these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>

<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file directly from the Export File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file."</seg>

<seg id="941">"the last option on this page is Maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .kin file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is in your database. that's why you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories to match them in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database."</seg>

<seg id="960">"applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & photoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & photoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>

<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is their presence."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to display sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM prefers that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most worth mentioning of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus, available. from toolbar to actions, everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then each in a multi-user environment on the system are available."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which emit the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please note in, and for more detailed information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all boxes, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarking or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right click in the editor area leads to a further context menu on the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string under the mouse cursor is a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, for example, & lt; insert into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu shown."</seg>

<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & # diff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white marks. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are shown visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"folder 2 folder 1 folder, folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"by selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders will be started. if a file is selected for A, but a folder for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the match.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you just need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; just copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't use & kdiff3; pull out. only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the dragging and insertion of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected one can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files, which is to be seen in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Gear] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the Springe buttons to find the next resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be resolved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes, by automatic merging or manual editing no more row is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the queue; this is only a placeholder in the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere."</seg>

<seg id="2315">"navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, side up, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the section merging and editing editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the selection to the clipboard, you have to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is checked, it will automatically copy the clipboard and manually copy it. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"newline ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline\\ r\ r\ r\ r\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files."</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">"select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"if you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic letters. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens at all."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"in systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the preset button automatically places an odd color."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"if this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"if you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"when this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"when comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others only store a newline '\'."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white notes."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"search intensely for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slow with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed on."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore ignores C / C + + comments."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation, see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge."</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">Changing this option does not apply to the currently running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries."</seg>
<seg id="2340">"on the selection fields for the encoding, a short reference appears what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)"</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which code to be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (e.g. your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessor commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window side by side or overlapping each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge then the name of the last output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is given first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is given (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command line. you can write your own preprocessor which complies exactly your requirements. each entry line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefix for line synchronization to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression of the text found on each string. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">"the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can use something else like perl -p -e's / RegExp / Replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details otherwise. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line sequence preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="2361">"often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively."</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without really performing it</seg>
<seg id="2364">... "performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),"</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">"if three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)"</seg>
<seg id="2368">"while reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed."</seg>

<seg id="2372">"if you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears."</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>

<seg id="2627">"all four types of order are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads it, this output is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders, as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with predefined strings of strings, such as: -) by text or for the reformat of messages from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems encountered on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screen shot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first of all, the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open. if this is not shown, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably not with system manager rights. the protocol files are usually not found in the / var / log, for the normal user usually does not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after typed strings. to do this, enter a string into the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so you will see & ksystemlog; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to see the important log lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol-lines of level indication. the color representation of log lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can switch to new lines from the main window context menu to view all the new incoming log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program starts at startup of the system in the & Linux world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not comment on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a new installation and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init is removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when changing to another runlevel. however, system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use for it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial range:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have changed something, you can repair it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel, which only runs httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running levels or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new range. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again attempt to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the various work ranges (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the font number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard running levels, and now the machine is constantly reopening. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated without notice, if their configuration files are not present or incorrect."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
