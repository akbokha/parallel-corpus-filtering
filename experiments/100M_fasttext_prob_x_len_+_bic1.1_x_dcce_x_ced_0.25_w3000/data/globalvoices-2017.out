&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is enormous .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
he never thinks of the mountain as you say so beautifully .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in pairs . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that absor@@ bs people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung agree not with the present publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
&quot; in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for life long for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits with the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp saw his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; ordering people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and interpre@@ ts an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account by the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , perhaps they would say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; pu@@ n white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much means as the great Van Jones , has killed just that which America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its President twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , a huge part of the white America gives up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is at the helm again , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone not , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

&quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ? &quot;
&quot; that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare lim@@ mer of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horns , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village situated on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra and so on . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the initial time : &quot;
&quot; at first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with an inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can effectively combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to stop one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior manager of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was unable to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which inter@@ sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . this means that illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , which circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas , such as those who point out that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal regime . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year due to the illegal fisher@@ man who inv@@ ade East African waters .
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ documented control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ed not start my port &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to accurately detect suspi@@ cious ships .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that links different levels of information to each other . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to display the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that previously had to fish without a license and had little to expect with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved at F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since f@@ isher boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ netz@@ e , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars go through illegal fishing each year . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures possible in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only was the ship without a license on the way and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s office .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the rural area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located Bun@@ de@@ ar@@ state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and power rates are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum for many is the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , sum@@ mon@@ ed the trial against President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration as part of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the protective shield : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; says the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures of confron@@ tations are pil@@ ing up , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government according to their own statements .
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the extent of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an official procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s included :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your v@@ ital@@ isation !
on the road !
&quot; others regard these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to stop critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept his sec@@ rec@@ y secret .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret closet .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with an ERP system . &quot;
pass only that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I will have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become en@@ vious .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were placed and chat@@ ted with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in it , and saw a couch where men were tortured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was stuck there .
&quot; they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ powered him with water and hun@@ ted him with a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... as a fil@@ thy win@@ der .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people sat quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my dad told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to information from survivors , the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , runs through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ izing .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils &apos; of war
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
&quot; back then at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war @-@ man &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges , which are taken away from an enemy that was fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war @-@ yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could join in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have been able to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we need no one else to do so !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still managed to bring clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense had accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
&quot; did these people not even have families , to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere , no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but there is always something left .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I simply said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ gations about all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I replaced the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with ensu@@ ing death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended on the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . &quot;
eleven of the originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ imer : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ cho@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who was founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the land on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial could be established there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license , in the last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ling@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; was mistaken , but perhaps also with malign@@ ant h@@ ind @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ appearing daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city just unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News occupied a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named re@@ porter published comments on the light that show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ w against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So fla@@ wed is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate it , you need two important skills : a passive language profi@@ ci@@ ency in order to understand the original text and language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French , not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is appreciated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translations show that this technique is not able to substitute a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) by the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters also survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which oppose Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was kn@@ ap@@ sed and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for telecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
&quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly , that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO &quot; &quot; Vega &quot; &quot; later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds fal@@ sely or refuses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to receive training &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ min@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ min@@ ta who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of cur@@ ative .
&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by the cur@@ ator , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she , who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ min@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ min@@ tas , in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange the child receives food , education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that children have to pay countless days of home@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ min@@ ta - especially young girls , affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ min@@ ta , guarantees silence in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies the exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred , which occurs in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of severe be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military service Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ min@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations demanding that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for prompt investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ min@@ ta
&quot; Cri@@ min@@ ta are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the way , and began to sell sweets on the street or market to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ min@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ isers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and reading edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; while he was intelligent , he did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; again . so they said Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , and they explained . &quot;
but she was completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken of is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ anes that are exposed to Cri@@ min@@ ta when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ min@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrative coordinator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please tell you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the authors of the ad switched on again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ min@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ mean , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , and the Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a cash inf@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ tail@@ ed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice , video viewer and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose its registration to the users . it is unclear how they should identify those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook , because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that the same way they control physical public and private spaces , can also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who want to apply for permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor human activities and also to supply them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative parliament and constitutional committees , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control will maxim@@ ise and ensure that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian Leopard in Iraq designated by war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization , Nature Iraq , are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the greater family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; The Per@@ si@@ can Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and health and the growth of the ecosystem also depend on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to setting up protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;
&quot; his works have been published in numerous international publications including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot;
&quot; Meyer directed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the North @-@ East Japanese daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o documented the progress that was achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , experiencing both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; even so , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and pol@@ l results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( the one @-@ at @-@ the @-@ time as@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by the shel@@ ters of dwell@@ ings ( the one @-@ to @-@ one , the Kaz@@ ak@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) remains to be res@@ ett@@ led into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and daily life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agr@@ arian land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , while only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents , however , find that still not enough has been done in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot;
how it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in their issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ees , still living in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often sees that a more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ voy is talking about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 took this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a beating against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his beating on the face of student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network where one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police sur@@ geri@@ es
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media has tu@@ cked street protests by directing the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo have specifically reported on a broken glass window , illustr@@ ating their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a fire set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any kind of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Villa@@ ges of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 quantity produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are already no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; between 2017 and 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , got their full salary for further training . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; &quot; he asser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in which he helped build it . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important industrial producer was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for the workplaces and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich taught that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to dis@@ su@@ ade it , they also stopped attacking the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they have become spare parts .
&quot; without a prospects for the future , many young people left the region once again . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ nine yields bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month , in order to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , nevertheless he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .

first Nations youths use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
incorpor@@ ation of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop aims to make the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also collabor@@ ated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ summ@@ ari@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters are not always native to the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot;
&quot; on the face page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead of our youth as well
so they can do what they intended the Creator to do
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the st@@ rop@@ he to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not shown only in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; based on a typical restaurant in Japan , one of the most popular restaurants in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes can be seen in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the proximity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( and the &quot; &quot; Plastic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend transforms them today into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new phone bands decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ers refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the food industry is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an orph@@ an @-@ don ( a popular dish with seafood ) was converted into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as cell phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and Hand@@ y@@ tapes of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , and , for example , the h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body lies behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go , and to look for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said , &quot; It is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out , because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ erin of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in Gu@@ err@@ ero State in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it appears : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who are sc@@ ared that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the hop@@ el@@ essness of the people is incredible to me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified with the fact that they were &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four @-@ month black@@ mail in the capital city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation marked by force . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy , for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father , shot by armed men coming from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this mis@@ representation of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the fuel tank fell victim to it . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people illustr@@ ating the World Cup . &quot;
houses le@@ aded and char@@ med corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to know .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ coal bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while watching them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been altered several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted visually . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ an military and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders from Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image has been presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely link the picture from DR Congo to sources of mass media to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian message , fal@@ sely claimed by 2012 , the President of Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein Being , Mon@@ ks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but had not taken the picture out of the DR Congo . &quot;
the Worldwide Range of Fal@@ se Information
traces of these false links date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture taken from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , occasionally others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to display the reach more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false cop@@ ing of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture taken from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only false news , but also discusses the abuse of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in the DR Congo ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known if the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; thunder@@ storms after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , which used the picture from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo was a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the picture taken from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a right to judge what it sees as &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to declare that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ arewell to a F@@ ew . &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , bringing the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture will still be included in this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 on students murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , Catholic @-@ related news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ dung y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was thunder@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , ag@@ it@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in Gra@@ u ) , Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original return of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslim - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the proliferation of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that restra@@ ining images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers , and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which examined how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be detached from the context or in a completely mis@@ use way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to be translated . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ gate ) .
but all resist persist@@ ently every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h to your parents in recognition of how you endea@@ vor@@ ed to have you in your younger years . &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have heated up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite ones here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon , which is normally used at the end of May , has left the banks of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following a statement from the Sri Lanka disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people were missing because of the floods and mud winds . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were closed on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on its way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are being completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Taxi @-@ Call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ op Center will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year following the cat@@ astro@@ phy of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat ret@@ ali@@ ation actions for flood and land@@ slide people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people into safety and provide aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; use approved . in January , I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others cann@@ ing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they ab@@ u@@ de me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different kinds . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , have to be m@@ apped . &quot;
to be taken away
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace and peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western vision , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as is the most popular translation of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the USA won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative is failing to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and to cover Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead movements for change . &quot;
it can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken of American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ rel@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children will become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan remembered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies beyond Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell her , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim only then was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ ologists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ pers her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my grandmother in my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how she gained a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi four decades ago .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a cor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over the centuries - was colon@@ ized by an empire , which founded a company called the Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ sistence of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ noticed history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military of the world , with troops scattered over every continent except from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is taking home the US and the susp@@ ects have a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ al Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people over@@ filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ c@@ tive lines , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing dup@@ licity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this doub@@ ting establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that are being bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely defines Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we drop to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically false image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ um@@ oni@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we are coming decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous im@@ prints we are ste@@ aling in our news outlets .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ game Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today a miss@@ able Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that might wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a history may l@@ ur@@ k where one is made to another . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enth@@ um@@ er@@ ated through the creation of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in public imagination , was even scientific by Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of becoming aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the pre@@ occupation that we had no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible response . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently talked about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been performing events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are .
&quot; while listening , often associated with it , &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to feel , feel , create . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first introduce their story in their own language and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their representation make the audience participate . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ ration typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells us the fa@@ bel of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siv@@ ity with a broad smile : &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old City of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural check of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing debts have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held ac@@ countable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt which is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with no party affili@@ ation , focuses on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed from outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , an event focused on the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Post @-@ Research ) . &quot;
the book published last year and available here license @-@ free contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of repression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the real cost is to which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from time to time extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 it was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
&quot; however , its place of stay and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and presently managing director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that created Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes had been for@@ esi@@ ghted as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recre@@ ate the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ mo book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together for a year in the book .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards &quot;
I forget the prison crowds
&quot; and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
&quot; that I bear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to bring back all the moments
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s arrest , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I &apos;m in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : res@@ ignation of the Director of Cor@@ ruption on Pre@@ par@@ ations for Cor@@ ruption
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption event , in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ vo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for dis@@ mis@@ sion of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the promotion well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , briefly C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should initiate a disciplinary procedure against the counter@@ acting .
&quot; the company was silent , however , and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had ended . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence . &quot;
obj@@ ection@@ able !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely offen@@ ded the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als and serves to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it were an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man , who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind a th@@ ief in jail : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever , but also as a sharp , tri@@ mmer and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . &quot;
an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting for 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , with which he comp@@ etes money , puts him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î»@@ Î¹@@ Î± ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) , 12 May 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo of the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( German : @ truth ) states that crime in Mozambique is paying off :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique &apos;s th@@ ief and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ vo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long life imprisonment , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or chips .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although there is still a debate about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or , as a part of an initiative , as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ u@@ sive con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radic@@ als nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ et@@ ook .
&quot; what should be done instead , is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to charge , post and share content for 24 hours because the Post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radic@@ als .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun to do so without local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great deal of turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the balancing hate speeches on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but rather than cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code concentration initiatives and learn from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the age @-@ related age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married with 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were eager to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; however , at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle once again posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was adopted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them voted against it . &quot;
&quot; once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who was a minister in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel &apos;s opinion was , it definitely took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ ales - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Her@@ vor@@ ing news ! &quot;
the marriage net has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly talked about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ related age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MEPs who were acc@@ using have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ birth abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible sn@@ ag comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj ple@@ dged his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to resolve his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General in Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite lawful if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to change the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; rather sat down , instead of talking so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters from being mis@@ used , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared Y@@ ar@@ news &apos;s local news service that they were h@@ ack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;
day by day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking .
&quot; although many engineering @-@ sav@@ vy web users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is available in spite of legal prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS tells about his efforts : &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a Su@@ hl@@ ende N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and full @-@ bodied colours . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ rate situation helps him in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was there and I immediately began to bend pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he was standing opposite tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to speak the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ment@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give women that they respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences should they neglect the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assur@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as house@@ wives , stood at a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage , HIV and AIDS infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion rounds , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
&quot; she has decided on this issue , because she wanted to open the conversation about patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; not to say al@@ oud to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they have all du@@ ti@@ ously maintained and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered dec@@ eit@@ fully as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of their husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ Ã­s of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she was ch@@ ich@@ ing only in front of herself during the whole exercise , another decided to release the whole aw@@ ful fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ plated dot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zinc @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
&quot; the other women have not ceased completely with that , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip on every disc@@ us club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who that could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing , morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will manage it . &quot;
Roh@@ ini confirmed that things have been moving slowly in the five months since their first discussions have changed :
we have only done little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and there are no other members of the family . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend that many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
&quot; also today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll will represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese people naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial Site )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of marketing , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; today , I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
that is how the day is going on today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; follow the h@@ ash@@ tag , and all of that , to learn more about the Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia &apos;s police warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of crew members for organ trafficking , probably for non @-@ religious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ le , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs had been removed . &quot;
two men were arrested and subsequently allowed to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man may contain gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , is human beings with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country carried out a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ford , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ orable Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already been following : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of non @-@ members individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith exist , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I would like to claim E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME . a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good grades , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for ab@@ erg@@ ing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mah@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ atz@@ heads : &quot;
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

we are deeply concerned about the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ g@@ gers in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ que &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; bases and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials experienced that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we are proving the honour of Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people is unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after announ@@ cing his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ im Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was stag@@ gering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government insi@@ sted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon crew to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts up all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; would like him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. embassy requested an angry response from China , with the declaration of the State Department that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ ti@@ ces around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him everyday , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with anyone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he is . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France would ultimately pick it up . &quot;
Taiwan in the United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental matters in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ er@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercising of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure Singapore &apos;s political system with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as well as cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the subject , the good old corp@@ se rises from authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leave the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really not answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised appropriate questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng appeals to Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point as far as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ easy even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities could win a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of a growing generation . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is correct and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ator ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city only ? &quot;
who does our prime minister need to pay back ?
what is the value of our rosa HR ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , exposed to the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series was written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook in anger when they are held to Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was , when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things happening around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to care only about our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans often talk over the fence along with the neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy . &quot;
music video of a Pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a Pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took the power and in spite of its promise to restore the civil government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and was given 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that have persi@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which accor@@ ds absolute discretion to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief about important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed as critics of Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict end against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ es@@ ties insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in Eastern Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , South @-@ East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians were living and working towards Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of the Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here . today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ echn@@ olo@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home . &quot;
&quot; as they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother prohibited us from photograph@@ ing , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , it &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal needs ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative headquarters in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a small boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children is now pursuing the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they begin to cry out : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she does not want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil already , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app von Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet them , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
it declares that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chi@@ ckens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children to people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers consult their phones calm@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s that she made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she imag@@ ines her short .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of U@@ rum@@ qi were given a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had mess@@ ed up messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remote control of their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ ure and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; , &quot; which published cens@@ ored messages in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen subsequently checked the inhabitants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it may be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the city council &apos;s instructions to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government departments , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; by the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ ma@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from within and from outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to its name .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around Stein have built . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so that I could &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all districts sought , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice against silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a gorgeous picture filled with my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return you to your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of Security Service . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you shout &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are brave enough to shout when we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you really trust what to look at me and not on the floor !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest chat that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father straight away . &quot;
&quot; his father , right with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot;
I passed through the yard .
in the first office I let everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I have all the details carefully before I enter the room .
otherwise they have probably all@@ otted to me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoner , and I am allowed to sit right away without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell mate was a &quot; first @-@ chief . &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my voice ? &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
&quot; there is no house here , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the interro@@ gation room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that are der@@ ailed to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become accustomed to not answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
my cries were not enough for him yet so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he came next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I am answering with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sl@@ ur@@ ls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine be@@ wit@@ ted lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ha@@ ye@@ witnesses ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned its proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he will have a special reluct@@ ance against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while in water he poured Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , and during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ me@@ g of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at neighbouring countries . &quot;
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison .
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert agenda . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was cancelled &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a more ever @-@ clear , emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b restored traditional sex men to the body by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently settled unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually trusted . &quot;
&quot; in the past years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ cide &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still app@@ raised that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that are long as tab@@ oos in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit hints on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been inv@@ oked to me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b raises the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in essence can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what one wants &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without any cuts , but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not contra@@ dict Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ it , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
there is nothing new in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service affir@@ med several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason that they were critical of the problems linked to the corruption of corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and thus also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ts , the drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan entered the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the disciples , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a car of 18 meters was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearances and bodily care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are all @-@ day . &quot;
a survey that was published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more regular citizens to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions like the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against bar@@ ber tools and instead of obtaining a training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community because of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

use with kind permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel dis@@ cour@@ aged ?
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la po@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the Treaty of Peace was considered to be so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; however , in front of Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak about true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and were carrying out their weapons around the clock must now be able to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans could join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people , who needed the most urgent response this year . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ a travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC stood up as they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Cau@@ ca , wrote this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ els &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful to me , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anybody would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in exile . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how the social injustice on the part of the state exer@@ ted itself upon the whole Colum@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often seen as a monster , and even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians have been prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ um@@ ova and its first publication on the website OC Media .
&quot; hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed like a ladies compla@@ ining about the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published which themati@@ zed the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and imprisoned them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; in the end , she moved into the USA out of fear for her life . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remedy this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was about to get a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to de@@ duct the family , you shame ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up at the hospital .
apparently some women got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which medical wings were you placed , in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without passing through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only ashamed of your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to van@@ ish from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without registering me , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian items are still in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are just not many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives in order to present themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison disappeared after their be@@ ards had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even present when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know , whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people that belong to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
&quot; I think , before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : how is this possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Defence of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; don@@ key is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you , because they thought you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
&quot; when he became Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic worsen@@ ed steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you post now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ d influ@@ x .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as the Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of a tran@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to come up , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all members of the family who felt hel@@ pless and incapable of feeding their families on the basis of persecution by the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab ancestors suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab population living in Iran is based , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the most profitable and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youngsters now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohamed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at cr@@ ushing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside of their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be employed , as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , also not with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came out .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be feminist .
&quot; for example , today , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make it possible for women to come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on black women , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
&quot; or , that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any kind of skin to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refer to the sex as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups which are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement still@@ ness , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of femin@@ ism , which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of taking me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ark@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book &quot; &quot; Afri@@ cana May@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming &quot; &quot; says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years , mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we have no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one of Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed churches can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ tex@@ tual . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ ffy ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police inspec@@ tor said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her husband , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed suspicion because of mal@@ treatment , the obvious ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her advertisement . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reporting to law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Stri@@ ke and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defici@@ ent realization of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ gy@@ n. , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office issued 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads were also here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements 40 % of women said that they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; any woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse will come to two women who do not do this , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violent acts by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should repent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to know : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
eventually her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach and poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ a@@ Men@@ os ) are part of a Twitter campaign backed by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ini@@ d is to be declared a stand@@ alone criminal record and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the wording of the law in some points has been changed in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and shall be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ ees most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which the victims of violence must bear in the present time , if they just want to refund and obtain a secure accommodation , to impose a state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are offen@@ ded . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a sentence of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the reign of Sul@@ t@@ ans is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , the public freedoms , including freedom of the press , limiting human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate human rights activities systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level parties bind hands of justice &quot; was published . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the head@@ line : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Legal Committee , was loaded from the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS accepted the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper were prohibited in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on August 22 , 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court pronounced al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence of imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Cuban government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been injured in recent times .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Alban@@ ian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Alban@@ ian authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial sh@@ kan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather , support and protect itself peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure is taken with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists will help build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious impacts on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself investigated the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ i health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that must change , otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being a mo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but meanwhile he needs longer , since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I must p@@ addle .
&quot; we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the kind Out@@ sh@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed initiative ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seed , cross it to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed industry , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed free at their disposal , in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be either not or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; such estimates still do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mas@@ se@@ dly grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those , through which their flavor or color improves up to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ versaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ tive due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks like this : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to facilitate their work .
this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , they create most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders would innov@@ ate by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it really easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be the leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , brings together a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore Os@@ si &apos;s commitment cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; it is now the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be scheduled for the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and help shape seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused above all on where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of Egypt &apos;s right and the constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law and give victims a voice . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post Office and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of articles and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas blog is located , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , as the police exercised physical force against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the government and reflected what this means for him :
&quot; blocking the blogs is very old , but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ wa al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog possibly is not significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers , through the conversion of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter contents to which Egyptian users may have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship is made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian Army deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers are reporting in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air river to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Global Justice Brazilian NGO even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; on August 16 , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; announced for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August . &quot; this is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; according to statistics from 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we watch the mur@@ der@@ ers per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit installed by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing one unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease in violent death . for some years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under attack after several reports on sh@@ kan@@ es and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also pul@@ ses serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to employ means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
it is now a week that the police get the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : taught Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding lands , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , on the basis of investigations carried out by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of the Assad regime was committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led to local residents needing to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the long @-@ standing block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional food crops in Syria and are rarely part of Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has fought for three years to make this project known and express its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ vis . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge about the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la said to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced prop@@ ell@@ ants are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds &quot; &quot; before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people of fung@@ al breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee shop , cardboard , etc ) to win new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity .

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal , and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and 70 were injured as a result of forest fires from 15 to 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks located in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal bur@@ sts in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from Portugal &apos;s farmers declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did so nowhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val adds further in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily combus@@ tible wood , were growing , like in a vi@@ cious circle , to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection website of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and was not able to stand on this fat@@ eful weekend in October : the website counted more than half a million acc@@ esses . &quot;

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it like that at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning grey , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt defen@@ cel@@ ess suddenly . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day . &quot;
&quot; true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high operating ratios , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af hid his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : dra@@ fts from Egypt enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ve Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration at a governmental authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the expul@@ sion of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which has been applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years already . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as well as over 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseudo @-@ property , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ dad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si meeting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ i Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the preceding case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists li@@ stens to trans@@ liter@@ ated documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of bill that would guarantee business@@ men and former regime dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ lawful funds received . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how pre@@ valent plans for the support of the draft legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to the new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
in the rules it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts assume that by doing this the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
would you like to see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for removal of content and to force them on request for the identification of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court dispos@@ es of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; Turkish court ordered the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the declarations , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it came to &quot; a source of information collabor@@ ating with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ling
&quot; after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased monitoring powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
