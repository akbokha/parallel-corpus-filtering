<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," I was, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fanatical love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in pairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that absorbs people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trumps Weltanschauung agree not with the present publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for life long for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump saw his way to the nominated republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"ordering people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and interprets an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account by the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, perhaps they would say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(OB.): as much as the White against all other ethnicities," pun white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as much means as the great Van Jones, has killed just that which America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its President twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the white America gives up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is at the helm again, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "no!" "roared the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone not, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">"what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura together?"</seg>
<seg id="70">"that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare limmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horns, timpani, bongos and the conga to play."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village situated on top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of Favio ChÃ¡vez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all produced from the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, Frank Sinatra and so on."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"at first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with an inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can effectively combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practised solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to stop one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior manager of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was unable to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which intersects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. this means that illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, which circulated information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas, such as those who point out that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal regime."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost revenue that the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to the illegal fisherman who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an undocumented control system, "" says Long. "" in the past a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You dared not start my port'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to accurately detect suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that links different levels of information to each other. FISH-i will help to find criminal vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the ocean protection organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to display the position of every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense, "he says." here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that previously had to fish without a license and had little to expect with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved at FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fisher boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board Schleppnetze, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars go through illegal fishing each year."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures possible in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only was the ship without a license on the way and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's office.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the regression of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the rural area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located Bundearstate Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and power rates are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum for many is the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="224">He told me I would become envious.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were placed and chatted with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in it, and saw a couch where men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was stuck there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, overpowered him with water and hunted him with a load of 220 volts in the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... as a filthy winder.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with handcuffs and were wearing eyes."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people sat quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied" "Why have you brought me otherwise?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my dad told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to information from survivors, the civil ist Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera, was the student RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial, runs through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the abductions came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look on the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of dehumanizing.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'spoils' of war</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all kinds of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">"back then at the age, I had no idea what the" "war-man" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or maybe military badges, which are taken away from an enemy that was fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if you go into a house and the fridge, record player, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is not war-yield but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the head of the security forces, could join in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have been able to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied," "You who steal cars on the streets?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one else to do so!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still managed to bring clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense had accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can burden me what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">'Enforced disappearance of the corpse is the last abheinous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you realize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have executed people during the dictatorship, but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">"did these people not even have families, to whom one could pass their mortal remains?"</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abhorrent act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed somewhere, no idea where." you'll never find something, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But there is always something left.</seg>
<seg id="307">I've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even stayed with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I simply said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him allegations about all the atrocities that I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I killed anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly repelled and asked myself what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "which they supposedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I shouted:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, then don't show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I replaced the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">Finally I realized that he was a criminal.</seg>

<seg id="346">Editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license, in the last month witnessed a particularly misused translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign, the Japanese word, the" "older motorists" "(koreilingsha), which means" "older motorists" "was mistaken, but perhaps also with malignant hind-thought & # 8212; translated as" "terrible motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">"from 1 to 20 September, the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself."</seg>
<seg id="350">"edited by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-appearing daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed." "terrible drivers" "(German:" "awful drivers" ") was later replaced by the appropriate" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture excused for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News occupied a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awfully "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate it, you need two important skills: a passive language proficiency in order to understand the original text and language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French, not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is appreciated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translations show that this technique is not able to substitute a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">"other online transmitters also survived the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, which oppose NicolÃ¡s Maduros government."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was knapsed and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS."</seg>

<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen "(" Flying Cows, decaying schools ") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she, who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began working as a Criminta for the family. as Crimintas, in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange the child receives food, education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that children have to pay countless days of homework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criminta - especially young girls, affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is inoculated to the Criminta, guarantees silence in general."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves "can be transferred to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with her and justifies the exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know of it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred, which occurs in secret in paraguayan households, but a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of severe beatings. shortly thereafter she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of the former military service TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck with a stick to MarÃ­n until it suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as a "modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations demanding that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta, sentenced to 30 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo will come to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criminta</seg>
<seg id="455">"Criminta are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls in their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all the way, and began to sell sweets on the street or market to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criminta to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time for learning."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>

<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would" "learn bad habits" "again. so they said Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of GuaranÃ­, would again speak their native language GuaranÃ­."</seg>
<seg id="473">"their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible, and they explained."</seg>

<seg id="475">"in the school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated against." a thing that is almost never spoken of is bullying and the chicanes that are exposed to Criminta when they go to school. "</seg>
<seg id="476">"because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criminta."</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="500">"picture of Pixabay, edited by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a cash infestation."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consisting of six paragraphs and curtailed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice, video viewer and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose its registration to the users. it is unclear how they should identify those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to come through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall on a national level around Facebook, because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" conducting research technologist ") of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly believe in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that the same way they control physical public and private spaces, can also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who want to apply for permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor human activities and also to supply them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative parliament and constitutional committees, before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense the control will maximise and ensure that no diverging narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the Non-Governmental Organization, Nature Iraq, are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the greater family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "The Persican Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and health and the growth of the ecosystem also depend on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard indeed in the wild game is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the North-East Japanese daily Kahoku Shimpo documented the progress that was achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's northeast, experiencing both the earthquake and tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"even so, Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and poll results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (the one-at-the-time asigai kouei juchaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by the shelters of dwellings (the one-to-one, the Kazaku juchaku) remains to be resettled into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"in 2011, almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and daily life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agrarian land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, while only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level, as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents, however, find that still not enough has been done in terms of catastrophes prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in their issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuees, still living in shelters, are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="629">"after the fall, the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region, and the factory lost its facilities until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop aims to make the young participants discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also collaborated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsummarium First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always native to the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a rophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the face page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, plastic dishes can be seen in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the proximity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (and the" "Plastic Models of the Courts" ") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district of Kappabashi, there are a number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend transforms them today into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome released the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the food industry is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an orphan-don (a popular dish with seafood) was converted into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile phone with salmon?. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and Handytapes of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other quirky plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, and, for example, the hashtag #"</seg>

<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>

<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>

<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a Leserin of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in Guerrero State in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it appears:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who are scared that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the hopelessness of the people is incredible to me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified with the fact that they were" soaked. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirred and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four-month blackmail in the capital city district: how a family has been plundered with threats. "in this, she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>

<seg id="794">We will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "Forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation marked by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy, for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men coming from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Ombudsman for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution had 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this misrepresentation of picture and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes, which were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the fuel tank fell victim to it."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people illustrating the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses leaded and charmed corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to know.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "by the Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charcoal bodies that are strung on the floor while watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been altered several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one remained behind to count bodies," "said a citizen of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted visually."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Nigerian military and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented orders from Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image has been presented as proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsely link the picture from DR Congo to sources of mass media to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian message, falsely claimed by 2012, the President of Burma's Thein Being, Monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to portray this information."</seg>

<seg id="928">"there are two strong topics or frames (framing), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslim - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>

<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"an argument is that restraining images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers, and they have the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which examined how violent media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually can be detached from the context or in a completely misuse way."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible response."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices recently talked about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has been performing events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the world's languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening, often associated with it," "listening" "these events instead" listening to feel, feel, create. ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers will first introduce their story in their own language and then explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation make the audience participate."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narration typical for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamus tells us the fabel of the rabbit and the baboon in Shona language from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamus ara is asked:" how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "he shares his feeling of inclusivity with a broad smile:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling performances."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"the goal of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started with the Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old City of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la deuda" (civil front for the neural check of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishing debts have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organisation with no party affiliation, focuses on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, measures imposed from outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here license-free contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the real cost is to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled" "Collective Remembrance" "gives his friends and family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time to time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 it was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of stay and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and presently managing director of New Palmyra, a project that created Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes had been foresighted as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recreate the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a promo book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together for a year in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that every one of the dangers doesn't matter,"</seg>

<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption event, in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Divoino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other defendants for dismission of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the promotion well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, briefly CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should initiate a disciplinary procedure against the counteracting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company was silent, however, and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "contradictory" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza is a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had ended."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Objectionable!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director doesn't have any moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him. I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so massively offended the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals and serves to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it were an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man, who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind a thief in jail:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to Samora Machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever, but also as a sharp, trimmer and - by the way - a prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations, when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not the case. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also negative:"</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or chips.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although there is still a debate about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar, "or, as a part of an initiative, as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar is usually associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, it is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radicals nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facetook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what should be done instead, is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to charge, post and share content for 24 hours because the Post" didn't meet the Facebook Community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radicals.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have begun to do so without local context or technical support and have banned such words as" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a great deal of turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't contain hate speech, but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post states" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to incite violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the Rakhine area where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the balancing hate speeches on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than censoring the word" Kalar, "it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code concentration initiatives and learn from them."</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously adopted a law banning this practice, so that the age-related age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors as,, every person under 18 years."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married with 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were eager to abolish laws on children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"however, at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">"now, only the president of the country must agree and announce the law."</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle once again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was adopted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and none of them voted against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>

<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular encyclopedia Wikipedia, based on the crowdsourcing principle."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many engineering-savvy web users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (no. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, the content is available in spite of legal prohibition."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS tells about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrorails when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employees of Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server further directs the inquiry to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself when they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and full-bodied colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's animal world to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"he described on Facebook, how this first-rate situation helps him in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was there and I immediately began to bend pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know, for he was standing opposite tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Buweik appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalymenta and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give women that they respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences should they neglect the norm to preserve this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assurances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as housewives, stood at a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years Rohini Paz has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage, HIV and AIDS infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in their discussion rounds, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she has decided on this issue, because she wanted to open the conversation about patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to say aloud to the names of their husbands is a custom, which they have all dutiously maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered deceitfully as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of their husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands over their lips," "says Rohini PaÃ­s of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she was chiching only in front of herself during the whole exercise, another decided to release the whole awful frustration against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said:" "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-plated dot on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinc-red dot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ceased completely with that, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we take a trip on every discus club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who that could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing, morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirmed that things have been moving slowly in the five months since their first discussions have changed:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and there are no other members of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages from those who experience it themselves, "and provide a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after announcing his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangering) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, Dichterim Liu Xia, to release or permit him treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway was staggering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government insisted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon crew to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his detention, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the U.S. embassy requested an angry response from China, with the declaration of the State Department that" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the following:</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavaliero accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure Singapore's political system with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as well as cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the subject, the good old corpse rises from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really not answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised appropriate questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng appeals to Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point as far as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneasy even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities could win a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country," he obviously didn't mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as leader of a growing generation."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is correct and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam have" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian advocator?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city only?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister need to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our rosa HR ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series was written by Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most put to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," I answered. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and live in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians probably cook in anger when they are held to Americans, but it doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag clearly visible in their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was, when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "is basically to be fun - just like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has his own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from things happening around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main property of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to care only about our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often talk over the fence along with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The dictator "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that have persisted in the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" "44 rules of the girls" "may relate to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which accords absolute discretion to the commander-in-chief about important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Africa "houses migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez directs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast, they begin to cry out:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli who has a joghurtbart) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil already, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." mum Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel together, and that Africans already speak at Whatsapp von Mrs. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet them, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chickens like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children to people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers consult their phones calmly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair stains that she made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she imagines her short.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'se fueron," repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan area of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had messed up messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remote control of their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme tenure and surveillance measures as well as routinely internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China "," which published censored messages in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen subsequently checked the inhabitants randomly to see if they had installed the monitoring app. "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it may be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the city council's instructions to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government departments, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on June 27, the authorities issued an ordinance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "by the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the rights of Urummais's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible, both from within and from outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor to its name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubt dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around Stein have built."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough so that I could" learn my lesson, "as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all districts sought, but my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that was stuffed into the arteries with state safety organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice against silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we united to a gorgeous picture filled with my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return you to your voice, after you screamed it all the way to the office of Security Service."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to speak:" let me also hear how you shout "Allahu Akbar" or you are brave enough to shout when we are not close. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you really trust what to look at me and not on the floor!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I didn't think you've forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest chat that could have such disastrous consequences for me, and yet I do not regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father straight away."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, right with that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is up to now in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture that I was subjected to months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I passed through the yard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I let everything I carry with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I have all the details carefully before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have probably allotted to me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with just one more prisoner, and I am allowed to sit right away without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to a tried-and-tested communication method: to beat the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell mate was a "first-chief."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after a long hesitation, he finally answered me."</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle-aged man who looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in the perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be seen on me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds similar to my voice?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have a scarecrow to drive away all these crows, which labelled on the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from afar, I still hear them screaming" Allahu Akbar. ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening, always at this time the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the colour of the perdition, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the Raad (for example:" "Donner", "allusion to 13th Sure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from exposing the traitor and terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played their confessional blackmail card and betrayed the narrow viewpoint of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"there is no house here, which is not a country here; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I cared for the interrogation room and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that are derailed to him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have become accustomed to not answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him and you cannot keep your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not enough for him yet so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, which is why he came next to an electrically loaded rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, lying on the ground, was the perfect power conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens, and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I am answering with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and go away, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of speech and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slurls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine bewitted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felhayewitnesses (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned its proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he will have a special reluctance against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a" Palestinian refugee of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I'm a man, "while in water he poured NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, and during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the smeg of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition of Dima Tahboub said that the concert was cancelled" just "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflecting a more ever-clear, emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib restored traditional sex men to the body by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently settled unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually trusted."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past years, the number of 'Ehrencide' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honor killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still appraised that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can" "be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison", "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from topics that are long as taboos in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit hints on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been invoked to me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib raises the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in essence can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated strikingly often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words," that can get what one wants "- whether faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexuals and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without any cuts, but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not contradict Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuit, who was to work later on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">There is nothing new in the hashemitic realm that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service affirmed several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association with the reason that they were critical of the problems linked to the corruption of corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and thus also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forts, the drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan entered the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the disciples, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearances and bodily care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are all-day."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey that was published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more regular citizens to go into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdresser" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against barber tools and instead of obtaining a training in hairdressing art, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year starting in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel discouraged?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Bogota and Cristian Palacios Foundation from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la poliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Treaty of Peace was considered to be so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of Colombians, there is still a long way to speak about true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying out their weapons around the clock must now be able to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians could join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people, who needed the most urgent response this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN warehouse in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up as they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive any orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the policy student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Cauca, wrote this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Camels" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warriors live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful to me, that's why I answer it." then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought anybody would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as a war, and the FARC already acted in exile."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have seen how the social injustice on the part of the state exerted itself upon the whole Columbian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often seen as a monster, and even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed like a ladies complaining about the LGBTQ community there is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published which thematized the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and imprisoned them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after experiencing a group of Chechens from the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"in the end, she moved into the USA out of fear for her life."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remedy this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was about to get a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying:" here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long do you still want to deduct the family, you shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which medical wings were you placed, in the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without passing through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world not only ashamed of your family, but the whole republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to vanish from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe you're in security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian items are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called" honor "experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives in order to present themselves Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that they can later be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically submerged to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison disappeared after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even present when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know, whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people that belong to so-called" non-traditional "orientation have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to" "civilisation", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">"OC Media: how is this possible, under the Sharia law?"</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubjeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Sharia has never hurt me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "donkey is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you, because they thought you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he became Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic worsened steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you post now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I applaud influx.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as the Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet, they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of a trandentity to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it's the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to come up, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hung."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all members of the family who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families on the basis of persecution by the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab ancestors suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab population living in Iran is based, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the most profitable and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohamed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at crushing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside of their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and thus be employed, as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, also not with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came out.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be feminist.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, today, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make it possible for women to come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on black women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any kind of skin to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refer to the sex as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dehumanized and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups which are also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender, because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement stillness, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and to join the movement of feminism, which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of taking me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clarka Hudson-Weems, the author of the book" "Africana Mayanism: Reclaiming" "says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the spiritual, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years, mostly with a surfboard or canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa says. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we have no water, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one of Erbil, Iraq-based documentary film and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, little noticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed churches can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Curtextual. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefrauffy) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police inspector said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her husband, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman Balbuena showed suspicion because of maltreatment, the obvious ad of Ada BÃ¡ez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned her advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reporting to law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Strike and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system, which is nothing inferior to Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient realization of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a researcher for gender issues at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Egyn., a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney Office issued 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads were also here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements 40% of women said that they were physically ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"any woman who is refunded for physical abuse will come to two women who do not do this," she stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a separate crime, the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violent acts by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" without complicity, no impunity. # Nononess "photo by Jessie Insfran PÃ©rez. use with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should repent for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to know:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women, who are all in some way victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Eventually her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner who developed into an impermeable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of its former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach and poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fÃ¼rst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMenos (# NononaMenos) are part of a Twitter campaign backed by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Feminid is to be declared a standalone criminal record and to punish the harsher as it is in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the wording of the law in some points has been changed in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the road to decriminalisation would be denied, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and shall be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foresees most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which the victims of violence must bear in the present time, if they just want to refund and obtain a secure accommodation, to impose a state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are offended."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"however, the cancellation of the words" gender, "" political force "and" sexual harassment "of parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback."</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Curtextual. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefrauffy) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2551">"since then, along with his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"the reign of Sultans is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, the public freedoms, including freedom of the press, limiting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and incarnate."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate human rights activities systematically and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline."</seg>

<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">"for Al-Abri a deposit of 5000 omani Rial (13000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released on August 22, 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"the Appeals Court pronounced al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced him to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari."</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his sentence of imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure is taken with his agreement"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists will help build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic first showed serious impacts on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself investigated the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sami health system."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>

<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"that must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being a mover."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are being promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but meanwhile he needs longer, since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the kind Outshgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative ("Open-Source" seed initiative) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seed, cross it to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed industry, "he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed free at their disposal, in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carton features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be either not or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates still do not exist for other plants, but experts like Luby assume that massedly grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those, through which their flavor or color improves up to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictive due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks like this: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we do not really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass-wise herbicides are needed, which breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents), they create most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders would innovate by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it really easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be the leader in the" "Open Source" "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, brings together a" open source "seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore Ossi's commitment cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law yet; it is now the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which will be scheduled for the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report. it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange it and help shape seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused above all on where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true, despite this attack and the ridiculing of Egypt's right and the constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law and give victims a voice."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post Office and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network due to alleged" support of terrorism. ""</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer exists in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for the distribution of articles and articles, which he writes for non-accessible websites and media in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he set up to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, was the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider of which also Ziadas blog is located, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, as the police exercised physical force against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada voiced the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking the blogs is very old, but has in the era of Abdelfatwa al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blog possibly is not significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"furthermore, afte documented the blocking of providers, through the conversion of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter contents to which Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship is made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian Army deployed in the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers are reporting in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro", "" Thieves robbing drugstore with military weapons, "" President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air river to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Global Justice Brazilian NGO even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on August 16, the newspaper" Extra "announced for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August." this is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a rubric in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes on:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and historic and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to statistics from 2015, 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north-east of the country. these are the latest available data."</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"if we watch the murderers per state, Rio is ranked 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit installed by the State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing one unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease in violent death. for some years, however, the UPP has been increasingly under attack after several reports on shkanes and repressions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also pulses serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this calls for the state to employ means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>

<seg id="2801">Source: Candoaction</seg>
<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding lands, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, on the basis of investigations carried out by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre of the Assad regime was committed."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to local residents needing to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"thanks to the long-standing blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own fungi as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to conventional food crops in Syria and are rarely part of Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has fought for three years to make this project known and express its relief that it now gains more and more" awareness. ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alvis."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge about the planting of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila said to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced propellants are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with the" "production of mushroom seeds" "before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach the people of fungal breeding for various reasons" ": breaking the siege."</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new food source on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal, and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and 70 were injured as a result of forest fires from 15 to 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks located in the northern and central regions of the country, reaching approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon."</seg>

<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval adds further in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily combustible wood, were growing, like in a vicious circle, to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection website of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as citizens were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used fogos.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt defenceless suddenly."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so we didn't freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high operating ratios, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and untrained personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained way of life helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf hid his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"a lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the unofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Asharafs aims reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>

<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also forges plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "he says."</seg>

<seg id="2932">"the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill, which foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration at a governmental authority."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"in order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of a successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the expulsion of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which has been applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013, while demonstrating violence against demonstrators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the impeachment of the elected president Mohamed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, as well as over 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in prison on a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-property, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosdad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi meeting block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Sami Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the preceding case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how prevalent plans for the support of the draft legislation look like."</seg>

<seg id="2954">In the rules it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
