that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally owned by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in it , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter does not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called on him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional addition , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although it was for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing to fail to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly concerned his telephone line , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , credit information , and even travel advice with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and risk . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned him more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work into play , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology has allowed the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source monitoring system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , as is the Washington Post Office . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the option of finding mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to talk about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer , who strikes alarm on the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; this week we were asked by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s ller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka doll .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information , less information must be given to found a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shocked us that all , up to one lawyer , made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to it . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to handle this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; that may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws .
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing possible . &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post office sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; eh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock out there ? &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at ti@@ thes to the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought depends on me today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends , who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate draws and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear in fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I joined . &quot;
had we just discovered that we had new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still with comfort would invest in a business , allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , remember the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design contribute something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to make sure that you unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel that they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who is actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eled to the office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name , when he told him where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 convic@@ tions that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked cell phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system enhances trust decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before placing them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , we trust people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from similarities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much one price is . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m going on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when everything is not going smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have spoiled flats .
hosts have let guests rise in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a fraction of a problem . &quot;
because people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , wonderful can be created . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgment :
perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
you can stay one even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing conver@@ ge with money transactions ?
it is an economic commerce .
&quot; but now simply calling &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
&quot; people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is compared to fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group of residents would be waiting to fill it thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that has never been heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were educated , and incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest in a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that start@@ ling
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
&quot; presumably , the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers . &quot;
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me , and against the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not just accept pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Koran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I was driving -- as we were silent -- as deep as we went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit neighbor@@ hoods , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t blame you . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ated to prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ filtered understand@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged into the free and sm@@ ashed . &quot;
there were really fire stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant person to people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alization it has been determined that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can do a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or beliefs . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups uph@@ old their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister , with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced them and said that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit news to test persons , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it can be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has been such a sealed young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting him in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or do we remain at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to go to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we rode sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed him and welcomed our guests , for the half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , work in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar business . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before moving air packages into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air equipment reaches high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build up self @-@ reli@@ eving structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; at the highest level . &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimal position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which get together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly away @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies are working with only one . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and move in space everywhere . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the om@@ ni with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates , or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard Micro quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ consider new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine on Broadway wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ve around each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not expose their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life on Earth had just emerged . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a giant laser detector - Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which improved the recognition performance enormously . &quot;
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes dri@@ pped through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measurable signals for 23 years . what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when the shaft is over@@ hau@@ led , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often perform a truly al@@ ber@@ able dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and cre@@ sted upon arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o staff declared to be crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometre long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a atom &apos;s radius . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ ceful and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; with them , we cannot manufacture any simple images of objects in space . &quot;
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same circus with an additional key change . this sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of motion vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard : &#91; Sur@@ render of the noise &#93; somebody who knows what he has to hear , recognis@@ es this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which spin around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before col@@ li@@ ding . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about space .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since this op@@ aque is .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own reflection . &quot;
with the aid of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the suction bones for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o offers us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to all , before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to say . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a matter of my smallest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ alley . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I sw@@ am to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , raise you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
each consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days , four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself and not only produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who are working as hard as you are a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t work with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ ened my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it &apos;s like I set troops on , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one toler@@ ates a high sound , ran a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a sum begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum ce@@ ases like a busy street , I could go on her forever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sum that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with television production began when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive differently than by size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed to fail , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more broad@@ casts I will , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out . &quot;
the sw@@ an stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my sum was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , thought @-@ out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sle@@ epers not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ mons .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are working , you love what you &apos;re doing , a teacher to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the hum@@ ming when you know the sums , when the sums are stopped , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sw@@ amp smo@@ ker , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ eliness and absence of bo@@ unds , I cannot do anything except fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl put in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of labour , the sum of Tit@@ ans , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sums depend on love .
&quot; the sums are the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
real sums are self @-@ consciousness and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums are simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the false words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do it as a rule , so that as a work@@ ah@@ olic , I can free myself from any debt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as good as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work rather than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst into pieces of soap .
&quot; I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you hold me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and talking about my teen@@ age daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner to make children ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show , when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to beat myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes a day , why not indulge in 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy streams in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
&quot; the sums of labour are part of me , but only one part . I am so grateful for that . &quot;
I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , descrip@@ tive , naked and new feeling of living in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said yes to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most famous ones , the &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one implant@@ ing an electrode deeply in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
&quot; it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain . &quot;
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain sw@@ ells , and the skull pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they preserved ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain matter from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we pl@@ ung@@ ed them at the sampling point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ graf@@ ting .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we pl@@ ung@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we inflic@@ ted a injury and re@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we last in the motor cor@@ tex the hand motor area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they relax at a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we re@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have discovered a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in humans .
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Luigi : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and attempted to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; at first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , along with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group would be mistaken , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are mixed , our future is dark and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; Twin Summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt @-@ mountain , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few know its twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and produce income , with which one could contribute to the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the US , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar sounds after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing , except infl@@ ating stock exchanges and raising real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently causes the circumstances that cause the body to kill it .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in questions of the state prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually in@@ filtr@@ ating politics and escap@@ ing them . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and still not in power , because the power from politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they nour@@ ish , dec@@ im@@ ated at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the economic demand falls , and the corporate managers are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash in their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ os &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economics , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that such long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , just as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has brought forth -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something that the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; resembles , in which machines the human beings serve , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in the near future . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong to companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time the liberal in which privileged persons are privileged and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Victor Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we see it up to date , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the impression of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I may say it so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now to pre@@ tend to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells like hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the long @-@ lasting denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to proceed that massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro zone , continued to deny the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harv@@ ester ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has not made any mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t there .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to case , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
this is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the credi@@ tors &apos; Troika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone would not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me it will be just as int@@ ol@@ erable for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of it , although he is probably responsible for 22 mid @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior manager at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to , where , after watching a squ@@ ad@@ ron , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at the end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average extra@@ dition , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows with an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where everyone can watch free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon comes out for nothing , you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over and look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data so as to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they show the shows , their performance , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we reach more and more statistics in order to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health System here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone here in the USA is in prison and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are generated , which is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google &apos;s research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows further into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , disman@@ tle this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for which they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what to do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
