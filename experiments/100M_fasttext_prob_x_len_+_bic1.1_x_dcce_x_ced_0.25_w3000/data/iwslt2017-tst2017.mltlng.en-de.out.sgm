<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA was illegally owned by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter does not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called on him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional addition, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although it was for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing to fail to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly concerned his telephone line,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, credit information, and even travel advice with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned him more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work into play, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology has allowed the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source monitoring system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, as is the Washington Post Office."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new spy technologies that jeopardise all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the option of finding misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to talk about grievances in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer, who strikes alarm on the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] this week we were asked by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a narrow friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent's ller or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matryoshka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information, less information must be given to found a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that all, up to one lawyer, made suggestions on how to transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to it. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to handle this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"that may sound very trivial as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see that something has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarianism, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who get up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering possible."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a post office sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "Where are you sleeping tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "eh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I rock out there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed at tithes to the door, and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought depends on me today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends, who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate draws and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I joined."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we had new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still with comfort would invest in a business, allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, remember the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design contribute something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to make sure that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel that they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who is actually Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeled to the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name, when he told him where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 convictions that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system enhances trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before placing them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"as a matter of fact, we trust people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much one price is."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi! "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "great works of art in your apartment! I'm going on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when everything is not going smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have spoiled flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests rise in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wonderful can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing converge with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply calling" "rental industry" "is not just the case."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is compared to fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group of residents would be waiting to fill it thoroughly and show you a neighborhood that has never been heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were educated, and incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest in a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that startling</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">"presumably, the people do not speak with their Uber drivers."</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and against the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not just accept passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists...,... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was driving -- as we were silent -- as deep as we went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit neighborhoods," "don't blame you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims congregated to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings came:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were unfiltered understandably, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the free and smashed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire stops on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant person to people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalization it has been determined that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can do a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhates their behavior and ideology is a traitor or beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups uphold their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive on what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister, with whom she spoke, silenced them and said that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given meaning to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit news to test persons, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you see when the mood swings against Muslims up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"in fact, it can be a tool for manipulating the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when it comes to the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has been such a sealed young man out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting him in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or do we remain at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked him and welcomed our guests, for the half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="408">"monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before moving air packages into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the audience."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, air equipment reaches high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-relieving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be" "start" "and" "start" "at the highest level."</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft will be able to regain the optimal position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which get together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly away-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies are working with only one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and move in space everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the omni with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates, or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to reconsider new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine on Broadway wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolve around each other in a very far distant galaxy, turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit up brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not expose their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life on Earth had just emerged."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a giant laser detector - Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to look for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be increased significantly, which improved the recognition performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes dripped through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. what are the gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when the shaft is overhauled, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers often perform a truly alberable dance in courses on the theory of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and crested upon arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo staff declared to be crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometre long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a atom's radius. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">"with them, we cannot manufacture any simple images of objects in space."</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transmute wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu."</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of motion vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard: [Surrender of the noise] somebody who knows what he has to hear, recognises this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which spin around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second before colliding."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen at the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since this opaque is.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by its own reflection."</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things in the first attempt that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the suction bones for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo offers us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, my fear removed."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain" "Yes" "that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a matter of my smallest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-alley."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swam to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I feel very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each consignment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days, four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself and not only produced, so I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who are working as hard as you are a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I am not just typing on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it doesn't work with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I deepened my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's like I set troops on, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one tolerates a high sound, ran a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sum begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sum ceases like a busy street, I could go on her forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sum that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's what she does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with television production began when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can't strive differently than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I'm not doomed to fail, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more broadcasts I will, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The swan stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, thought-out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium sleepers not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summons.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are working, you love what you're doing, a teacher to be a teacher, a banker, to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the humming when you know the sums, when the sums are stopped, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says:" mum, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone any more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my swamp smoker, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and absence of bounds, I cannot do anything except fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is letting go, or whatever the girl put in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of labour, the sum of Titans, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums are the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the false words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do it as a rule, so that as a workaholic, I can free myself from any debt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as good as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work rather than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we move around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into pieces of soap.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you hold me naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking about my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner to make children ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "games" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to beat myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes a day, why not indulge in 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy streams in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of labour are part of me, but only one part. I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">I've never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, descriptive, naked and new feeling of living in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think things out, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most famous ones, the" "deep-brain stimulation". "in doing so, one implanting an electrode deeply in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">"it truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain."</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas the brain swells, and the skull pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain matter from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we plunged them at the sampling point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autografting.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we plunged the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we inflicted a injury and replantied exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been replantied.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we dye in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we last in the motor cortex the hand motor area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they relax at a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we replanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have discovered a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Luigi: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and attempted to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"at first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, along with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup would be mistaken, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are mixed, our future is dark and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "Twin Summit paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt-mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and produce income, with which one could contribute to the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the US, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion dollar sounds after a lot of money until it compares with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing, except inflating stock exchanges and raising real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin tops, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently causes the circumstances that cause the body to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy based on these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about Athenian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in questions of the state prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two by gradually infiltrating politics and escaping them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government, and still not in power, because the power from politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals they nourish, decimated at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the economic demand falls, and the corporate managers are too scared to invest the cash in their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demoos "out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economics, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that such long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, just as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to restructure the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has brought forth --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" Matrix, "or something that the society in" Star Trek "resembles, in which machines the human beings serve, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong to companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time the liberal in which privileged persons are privileged and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Victor Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers is called" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we see it up to date, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the impression of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I may say it so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to pretend to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells like hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to the complacency and the long-lasting denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to proceed that massively threatens the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro zone, continued to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Harvester...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has not made any mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to case, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">This is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the creditors' Troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone would not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me it will be just as intolerable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for having been with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of it, although he is probably responsible for 22 mid-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior manager at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to, where, after watching a squadron, your brain asks," Where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what's going on at the end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average extradition, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is available, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows with an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where everyone can watch free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon comes out for nothing, you get too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data so as to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they show the shows, their performance, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, it is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we reach more and more statistics in order to make serious choices, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health System here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone here in the USA is in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are generated, which is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google's research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows further into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the case of law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious choices, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, dismantle this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, for which they wouldn't have been able otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what to do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
