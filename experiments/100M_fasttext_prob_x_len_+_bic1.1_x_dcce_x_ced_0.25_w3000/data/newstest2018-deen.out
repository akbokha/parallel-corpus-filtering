Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an irr@@ ational institution where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where now is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former land of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it gets annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everybody knows this , who already had to rain , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a carpet of fli@@ ck@@ ering that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; the large map became more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mates &quot; &quot; for cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
&quot; the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and issued a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , the current neighbours who created the idea of a region covering Bavaria @-@ map were scre@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph moved the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Government of Sur@@ veying . &quot;
the memorial sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison spring / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub @-@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; it was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a district in Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , there is nothing but a field - at first sight : when zo@@ oming , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption , &quot; from which the basic tax was deduc@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the October festival since 18@@ 10 , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the Ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k @-@ rent institution in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet at Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs opened many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention while traveling through the state and be aware of extreme caution since a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ utions that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim for minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have injuries of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they will be stopped because of their skin colour , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring their deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report of hate crimes reporting the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration infrin@@ gements , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ locality together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the Rot@@ ary cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five flats holiday homes . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional .
&quot; since he is also chairman of the fishing village BL@@ H@@ V , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much must be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography here , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even though he did not perform bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the area could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for their support
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; thus , the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by Leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained twelve 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of soft fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss was firm : &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape sp@@ lin@@ ter line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art fo@@ stering of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a material that is marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be tu@@ g@@ able ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man Spring project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence , the stag@@ gering down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty mo@@ ckers would have ra@@ ined him if he had done it .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to its importance , and especially the importance attributed to her , as the famous poem by Emma , Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is really correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh apost@@ asy &quot; could be seen better on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical portra@@ yal .
&quot; Lazarus also changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world champi@@ onships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the Middle @-@ stre@@ cken@@ ner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season that included the British team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are at the Olympiastadion Berlin again .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking criticism on Facebook : do not appeal to a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he was chat@@ ting with criticism , for sure . &quot;
but he has not put his critics into silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the headquarters of the Gover@@ nor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are more likely to be regarded as a so @-@ called collective use rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical messages or to arrest or arrest prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of papers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter t@@ ach@@ ographs hit his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ powered his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers by George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days as the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took links to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
I won &apos;t be able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year I had won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish show ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eck . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer rates due to passive smoke
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said the director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he referred to his own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continuously hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s reputation . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ech@@ ariah , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai ra@@ ids in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber will be removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from nearby sw@@ amps . &quot;
a bucket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote for public raising in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up its independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split off in Papua and West Papua , whereas the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans converted a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vivid , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her pale coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua , Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua New Resources has a estimated 78 billion US dollar value . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal slaughter of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
screws have strengthened since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the inhabited islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung ch@@ urch@@ ins sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives , who went to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as the Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ech@@ ariah , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - running in a circle and im@@ iti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ neighborhood of En@@ ech@@ ariah , saw the im@@ minent danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ li@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; charged with crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity , Wi@@ ran@@ to , demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been submitted in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such asser@@ tions with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ belief .
&quot; I was viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting down and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured have quickly arrived here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua , by insti@@ lling spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in beta @-@ carot@@ ene , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
&quot; Papua , however , rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Master Council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film them was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of the Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign , the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development , were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia to the most eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but still wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election for 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was held on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 m high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ ell tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the shou@@ ting of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units around 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outer casing for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for isol@@ ating and facing the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the two @-@ thirds majority of Davis Cup singles were only supported by the two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles . &quot;
&quot; this often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics remain thus preserved to the traditional rate . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the president of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the applications .
&quot; at all , not until the vote had already come before the proposal to put the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less formal media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey of air passengers shows that more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously prohibited items pass by at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they were acci@@ dentally wearing forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been late to discover that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent said know@@ ingly to have borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately prohibited drugs in the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gling goods had been brought by airport security , and how many had intentionally done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who most often fly . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , the people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ scored that a part of the customers has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ ph@@ ed figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant number for the first time on the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly trial : the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car which has just begun . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now cle@@ ars : 6@@ 3,000 of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are taking place , spati@@ te mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be solved . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , unprecedented production lines without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are too much delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt is withdrawn from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules on reducing emissions due to the postpon@@ ement of the rules
&quot; a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , rec@@ alled his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions from harmful air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period that was scheduled for States on 1 October in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulations which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that the revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement set the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EP@@ O &apos;s statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ assessment of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group inten@@ ding to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and the safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ ors to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Jahr@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the hill with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ Ã © at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a royal court to which the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ al Law belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 prove these historical circumstances .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , ref@@ using and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit this church . &quot;
this ent@@ ailed the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two cru@@ sts on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ nants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius ch@@ urch@@ yard also served as the last resting place for the victims of Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the tower existing today still remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organis@@ er , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ nen invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle , on Sunday 16 July . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers have fantastic views . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and listeners . &quot;
&quot; the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ens feel particularly committed to homeland care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot;
association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Council . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim fights &quot; is called upon by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones aim to prevent the landscape from being spar@@ ed .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved the district government due to a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette the construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are estate . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be met by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ family households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ stepped gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove the L 3@@ 33 in direction to Bo@@ gel with her car in the course of the accompanied driving with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ī@@ ga and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities of the city centre . &quot;
the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should be sensi@@ ti@@ zed to the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city center . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all trade professionals and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost the city centre when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - up to land@@ lords , the farms of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly made itself broad , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , said that in Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities will take part in the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his direct environment himself .
two deaths and several wounded after an explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them hard . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later recovered as well .
&quot; in the case of the dead , the school was an employee of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp uses in@@ feed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compla@@ ined because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to his report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp , Mr. Turn@@ bull told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA would be &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activ@@ ist activ@@ ates rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ p@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury travelled through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n -- -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience clas@@ ped very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights activists have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were checked by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever indic@@ ted because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of post@@ production . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a sheet about the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI der black Far@@ mer , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Ms. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore , did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , dispos@@ ing of evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more form@@ less .
&quot; it was an election @-@ right massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant and rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened to a well rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not that way , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com who cries out and presses him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always smiling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors was funny . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos;s mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels donated . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms weeping and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at one table a white pair from Atlanta was chat@@ ting about the post@@ ings with a black pair , which they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky tried to find words which left the performance behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone believes Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ employment is in a way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story cou@@ l@@ isse . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ timer is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ breeders pose as a rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which draws itself through its &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three birds of the Rhine - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; they mis@@ lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a corp@@ se in the trunk of Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ wei@@ ght@@ box .
&quot; brut@@ ally the scene , when he was killed by Siegfried . &quot;
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still needs to believe . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual wear . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ lim@@ mer pipe concert about himself , five years later there was a great jubil@@ ation in which the scattered &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have also worked in the open day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does this come about ?
quantity : I did a high @-@ level polish .
&quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe even , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really is going on .
different from the degree of civil engineering ?
&quot; amount : well , here is not a question of calculating st@@ atics . &quot;
there are always other people who have a different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3.000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British Educational Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts , which the General Director John Fall@@ on announced in the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will come in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killing a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured , sharing a statement by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to take place when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which are in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car was killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , where States are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 States su@@ ed the Agency for the step of step . &quot;
&quot; late on Wednesday , the EPA announced the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; and said it shows the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and because we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt has announced the intention of the EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollutants are to be measured in a part of the country , in order to stipul@@ ate where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay one year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s bor@@ ough , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp tried to rec@@ laim a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tru@@ mp , should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that breathing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in case of two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement facility . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take time until the church community is owned by the church , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion on a common space . &quot;
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council proposes that such a common room should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the re@@ development area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect he doesn &apos;t want to throw a stick between the legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - as well as the roof @-@ roof - would be possible , as well as the construction of economic power - that would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried sole means this addition . &quot;
&quot; when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings with which one can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very hard to do with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to any wealth or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value that is comparable in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to split the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cycl@@ ist is s@@ lung on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he obviously did not see the traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game play against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the personnel worries at the German soccer record master Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said and added : &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot;
&quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , hike from star to star &quot;
&quot; in the resin , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; this is planned by the association &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information for many visitors , it was named . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; As@@ k St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be complemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception will play a role in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star path will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ base , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why one star was more lumin@@ ous than another , although it was considerably farther away . &quot;
I will also learn in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , since 2003 there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end of the d@@ warf Planet - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distant sun measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oned world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia recalls . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 Po@@ unds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so large . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight counter &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound dé@@ but this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight contest in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ tors after Tire S@@ plat@@ ter
&quot; in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Za@@ fir@@ a was losing control of his vehicle after a tyre plat@@ ter shortly before the junction of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the fal@@ si@@ fication , where he over@@ flow@@ ed and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the North for about one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defensive formation brings in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , that would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to go even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ bo@@ box should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after an off@@ shoot , the tun@@ ics want no more to catch . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ ton@@ ed chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many play@@ mistakes in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one can speak after a draw from a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I first rated the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to strike from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief Executive . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum application test published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the people who have been tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Board ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , Migration Board has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 test cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases which &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it for sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is neg@@ li@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the department of road engineering and traffic in the government president Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work started at the same time at all three bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building end is planned for October and Easy is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a wooden v@@ aul@@ ted wooden bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sandstone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is an edge attachment that is also used as operating mode .
&quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian path is to be lost .
&quot; the special thing is that this is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot;
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish must first be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting hamlet in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is single @-@ lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges is 2,@@ 700 000 Euro . &quot;
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of vul@@ can@@ ic spirits ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful colours on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the &quot; big election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the beginning of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that can be found there .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum One World and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pe reports from the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he stri@@ ves for such an event and received the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation , because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us cherry there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ ois is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle there are several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ person Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 people in the audi@@ torium who are waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch speaking their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; in the row of Has@@ la@@ cher mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church , there is a hearing with the Wolf Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo trumpet of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; thus , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play combine into a fascinating complete artwork . &quot;
this core of the program was first premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try it out , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was their &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is ass@@ uring the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was really in love with whom I had taken . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so I have never confused or imp@@ eded me .
&quot; I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among them I suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes reports that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , in@@ coherent message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin testified at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ pped off gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his commentary , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , starting in London on Friday , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free , told re@@ porters in London following a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral ceremonies for soldiers , crashed in Mali &quot;
&quot; at a funeral service in the Northern Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers in Mali were thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; as a matter of fact un@@ clari@@ fied , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; it described the two inver@@ ted pilots as &quot; &quot; chi@@ ckens of their subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Northern H@@ esse met in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives in the church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral procession began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the mour@@ ners laid down roses , and the members were arm in arms in the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the incoming soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and penet@@ rated .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , the Minister , of the Le@@ yen , did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country , of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral celebration , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the German army did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this was handed over to the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said it further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also called the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ mahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , &quot; &quot; L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by said , &quot; &quot; the head spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always up to date , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in Germany had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from its district parliament in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ owns founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to include them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be conven@@ ed on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be scrut@@ ini@@ zed by law , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; but a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have received immediate effect on their land reform , which they received over the green country list , &quot; &quot; said the regional chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ owns . &quot;
they decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the Gre@@ ens Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ owns to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal President of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian put her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has done this dirty in@@ filtration and tries to make political capital .
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its MPs to take El@@ ke T@@ owns into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the results of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal care@@ gi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD , strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves against greed , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , health hazards are practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the selling products are market@@ able and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual hardness levels of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not have an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
is there any lack of personal or conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be submitted are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is regular alert at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to exclusively get safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
this must be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the football rules of football have an impact on N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation controlling the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar signed and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players but have to counter@@ act with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring its losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which used Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build up a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P payment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of SW@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine 60 million euro fine ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambass@@ adors and find such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , announ@@ cing the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has reached a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that the sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new product supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order . &quot;
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate tablets per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a toy manufacturer .
&quot; as many applicants find it in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty in the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss company has distributed chocolate boards on board its flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class ni@@ b@@ ble passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short stretch , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , had failed in the national championship competition and could only look at the disc@@ us competition from the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who cast 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres wide , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first day of camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a pleasant tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors gam@@ ble children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ bert a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could kind@@ le this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; at Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time watching chess on television like Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ di@@ ated to a lesser extent , could better supply his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for food for a few days .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the Country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz informed Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials arrested large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two people were arrested in Italy at the same time . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been conducting an investigation against the organised drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the great use on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the investigations , Italian citizens were mainly concerned with the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
manner compla@@ ins large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has reported to a media report on large gaps in the For@@ eigners &quot; Central Register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly serious wrong decisions , &quot; in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the statements , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by some 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases dates from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or citizens who have become German citizens and are not supposed to appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics above sufficient people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; but such false assur@@ ances led &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate &quot; , &quot; says the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they are left there . &quot;
&quot; this is what emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF can carry out such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if an immig@@ rant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; in order to justify this , the office now has to write : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has submitted guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman for the left @-@ hand faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening human rights abuse and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gr@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation hon@@ ors multiple eag@@ ern@@ ess to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the council . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , as our body is designed for it and we give respect to the don@@ ors that make their blood available for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; underlined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district authority of the German Red Cross ( D@@ RK ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , corn enb@@ acher reports about the actions carried out in the spring of Upper rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the D@@ RK circle team leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre &apos;s house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Ren@@ ate counted among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 @-@ made blood donations each . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara pl@@ ur@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise . &quot;
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it held interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members stra@@ ined in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alised that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to brid@@ le the inflation @-@ heated inflation and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it was said that now it is expected that it will provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to de@@ strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are forecast to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May , compared with the forecast figures predicted in May . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a price increase , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years does not &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; income tax , &quot; &quot; but she added that wages at the end of her three @-@ year forecasts will &quot; &quot; recover considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably last four years until it will reach the prices and the economy completely .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for a interest rate increased since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , while three polic@@ y@@ makers claimed a rise of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ück , Director of Cor@@ eco mortality Bill Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and would like to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is expected to prescri@@ be 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pre@@ operative proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered from the health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is systematically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; in September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we hear@@ ti@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot base has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overl@@ apping each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an attic where one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed together without having to bend us .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explained Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and simultaneously use high @-@ quality materials , which give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electric sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , dealing with one of Victori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate investments worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business may be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court record says that Col@@ in has property valued at $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian legacy dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi spoke often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars on leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday that hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
the new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new staff of staff , met with leading employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s White House , which he wanted to fix : poor information that fell into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media control .
&quot; President Tru@@ mps &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was upset because of fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping the Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mps &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never find out about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep his anger away from him , then their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , will again and again try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that potentially promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co - occupied entirely with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of the advis@@ ers , to the president for strategic reasons , dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on wh@@ ence they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the people &apos;s assistance will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally unknown , critics from the population will be raised and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the promotion launched on the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; advent calendar in winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many cur@@ es were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 postcards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online songs have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the war foot , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road by Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire row . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their fall . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it since it was useless when dealing with the problem .
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge , if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot;
&quot; an ab@@ orig@@ ine who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ king 101 . &quot;
this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the forest hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof located by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the site and already spoke of serious interested people at the house .
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the Three @-@ Star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building construction sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings are broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is a lot to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher centre level , emphasizes sh@@ ear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s noti@@ ons are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; looking at the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the outer complexes are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee has recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper noted the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
&quot; the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ed , there are already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
us intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for some time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation is aimed at several men who acted as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at the private and business environment in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the center and investigating whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime crimes and to decide whether to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called the In@@ dict@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite persons for interro@@ gation among E@@ id .
&quot; according to the broad@@ caster CN@@ N , pre @-@ charges were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , people who participated in the meeting had been asked to testify . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his campaign boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should act quickly if needed . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a grand jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any actions that expe@@ dite the work of the Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI director James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been loud , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp has asked him for setting up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , about the late president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; there were two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday , according to which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened the ice shelf . &quot;
this was announced on Wednesday by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research .
&quot; over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss drives north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg , it is unclear after research data . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual clas@@ hes in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture so far .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this ice cream , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ uses was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete flock of ice falls down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be dis@@ integrated if a piece breaks off at a key point . &quot;
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture is the fourth biggest investor of Antar@@ cti@@ ca . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres . &quot;
there it crashes on a regular basis .
&quot; although there is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will be growing again or fall back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers don &apos;t lead the demo@@ lition of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ cu@@ ffs of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature increased .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U requests from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the circle day has crossed 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing to be able to handle the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are currently 50 un@@ occupied positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and human resources development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements to experts , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented applicant shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age . &quot;
&quot; high time to act , so no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter colonies , faction leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long ago caused a rotten surprise already in the C@@ ret@@ an &apos;s day , when he questioned the personnel costs and start@@ led the rest of the parties . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the CD@@ U attempts to pay the employees and officials even better than it actually fores@@ ees the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Regional Director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy to ag@@ grav@@ ate the sound of NGO @-@ migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to the detailed alle@@ gations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in a statement about the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations that are being raised at the moment , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1,3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; by now , Minn@@ iti states that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in der Nord@@ pf@@ alz in order to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot;
three befri@@ ended guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour took place on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ ad . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; once more , the lookout spot looked at the lookout spot , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ ated &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers in the open air inhal@@ atorium offer healing br@@ ine . &quot;
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pal@@ atine forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sports
&quot; in the future , the sports stars will sit in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium racing in wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ it included . &quot;
this has also recognized the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons who are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; that there are still several clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organizes the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke und Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; in particular , real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will continue to die in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal debt to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA are dealt with at the level of competition . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , the pros have long established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a proper sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and mind nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but ac@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientists highlight the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles . &quot;
a study of corporate advice Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales will be around 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant writes . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport betting providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
deca@@ ying only in nostal@@ gia and clearing old times is no longer enough .
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t stick to that only with football everything remains as it was always .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free up to his appeal .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and looking down eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which they totally regret .
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , which said that there is &quot; no day when I am not deceived by the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person I have been together with since I was born , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another , commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the event .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me allowed me to run on the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern will give the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; what was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the obj@@ et could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which had been commented out of the holiday , but he was chosen as a game guide . &quot;
&quot; naturally , sugar is distributed to those who want to have a lot of fun , which one wants to keep in a mood . &quot;
&quot; so , those who were chosen to compete with L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ olos confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; right back , this is his position , the white bind on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this kind of starting formation like the one , who can take the helm at the best . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal to re@@ play his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the devil come out to the benefits of the Asia trip ( only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot not neg@@ atively impact . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also brought . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usually this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ olos said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cris@@ p statements .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ aric minister : economy lo@@ bs bis@@ d@@ ress@@ ings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region address T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously t@@ ad@@ le the old Minister of Ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ circum@@ vention of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to start the track in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier pursu@@ es , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce commen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master Bonus the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates take up the master training independently within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road building will be quick to provide facts , but at the same time it is out of the country where necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to adjust knowledge in state @-@ run mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf added to this on calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of regional roads than suggested . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a rating of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thereby restricted itself to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of intoxic@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several members of Volkswagen were charged in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily impact Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to join , on Saturday , a raft passes through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you pull again to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between the F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
and this is not a common raft with Is@@ ar tourists .

on the raft you can see a large inf@@ low fuel .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protected game of game . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he worked as a illustr@@ ator for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , his dro@@ pl@@ ets still find much spreading worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a back@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to reach the cinem@@ atic wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is reproduced without a word . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened with climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively end@@ anger because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia &apos;s R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column , no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while the corp@@ ses are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 when President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ sia , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are suspi@@ cious of all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce &quot; &quot; in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but for Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ren@@ ounced , two @-@ storey mou@@ se@@ boxes for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was the release of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , assumed power @-@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined with five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in equity hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever she led . &quot;
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ c team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who gener@@ ously embra@@ ced embra@@ ces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you engage with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their insi@@ dious start and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells false , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ sia Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - not just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room in which the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself referred to as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has focused on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former known speaker Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the city &apos;s home town .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , led through a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows , that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers would have considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few characters and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked for her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
the media war@@ der group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am due to my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug trade was frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to hum@@ ming . &quot;
a series of shooting with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the spa Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the cur@@ b , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens were nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ c followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send her for reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used clo@@ aking to avoid enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ rs living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock out of the square , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy crude oil . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shield technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to better interfere with its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dose family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the pinn@@ acle of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this cam@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors have been in the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal as evidence of his life , including his preserved colon , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved and sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just put a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the sn@@ out to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hanging from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the Under@@ water cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery prize . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass incar@@ nation on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , around 17@@ .00 clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were under a storm under 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ locked . &quot;
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; it was an easy to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer @-@ long re@@ sta@@ u formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also a massive han@@ di@@ cap on the reverse train - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade made a note of the vehicle &apos;s characteristics , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is just sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : exhau@@ sts .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the railway ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will be published . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the train atten@@ dant comes to third place at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train guide , you simply check in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; those who go by train often know that next to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest nu@@ is@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; for many times one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further reference numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; devoted to Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos; lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she started her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive evening later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vering . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , carrying a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves in order to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground when the activists were awaiting the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business@@ man who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new form of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; a question came up to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt insi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for that is how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ el &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ beard Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to wear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who fed this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; It would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etze ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , from which the other stores benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a room with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is this too . &quot;
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle on the amount of rent .
&quot; this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why buying palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of them in our city .
you can see how many store shops are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle will remain . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , as the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or does the ghost bit gallery even manage to distribute all the business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping centre that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; once the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ t@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publicly classified diplomatic noti@@ fications about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and landmark dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit some intellectual commentary not only about the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing deliberately sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came out of the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in it , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal partners , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would change Chel@@ ny &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp fires a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the stub@@ born spl@@ its he actually had to fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific glos@@ sary of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic book . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ on phone in the hand from the United States &quot; disciplinary collections such as King Kong .
&quot; if they cle@@ ave your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never keep your mouth shut . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , with which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford looking for murder
a nation @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are considered susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by the Cook County Court of Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the site of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K Cub@@ anda , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them has now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago &apos;s police authority , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timetable has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explains Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ at @-@ Law Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main district of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is on the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , to offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for keeping their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys from particular teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can follow why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and identify bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
he has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or behave in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have been hidden and addressed in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; he secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are unlikely to come as a surprise , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets , such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In which has both Con@@ ver@@ sible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies operate well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can grow frustr@@ ations and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it starts at 23 : 00 p.m. when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their audi@@ tors after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center in the morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a real treat for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ into @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August 18 , they will be doing 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the rules of regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ unge on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practices once the camp is finished , as in the light of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been evacu@@ ated with foot@@ balls , that will be a protective grid behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ into players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then choose to record an exercise there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fac@@ t@@ len@@ ders from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fac@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , which may display results of the Fak@@ ten@@ Testing from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish hate @-@ filled post @-@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual players are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes in his news feed to reduce false news .

&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always sm@@ ite after smoke , because at that time a fire was lit for the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ b ) &quot; seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received full access only in 2006 , when Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what was possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
&quot; the S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is depicted , who stage his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men solved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about her@@ es@@ men , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; Oh , now I have to be done again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the closure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef opened its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; they write on their website that was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , she is competing with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a middle five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week too .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as formerly , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s seat of office . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations . &quot;
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire pull of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , it is negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; god@@ gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ sten@@ ing at the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ quarter ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the wholesale failure in the army and security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 prosec@@ ut@@ ors , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly belonged to the masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of worldly state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is aimed specifically to advance the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer , who searched for asylum from persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this applies , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way the United States will change the way citizens from other countries are issuing Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for race car
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the podium has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the tourist train will be built on the mar@@ o@@ des track . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the race ticket , construction work will still begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g section , the country is particularly well @-@ known for tourism , &quot; stated traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will take over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should order the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is one of the most popular railway links between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; says True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; be in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ ling one the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have a Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consu@@ mer@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps through the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the world in which there is a president in the White House , who has been bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the po@@ ised eyes , but how realistic this vision affects . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no communication or background history , nothing indicating independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the speech of 2017 : maid girls
how much power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp sel@@ fish relatives . &quot;
we all commit ourselves to bur@@ sting our filter bubbles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp , to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but in a further context it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even worse long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the Right wing , which suddenly appears to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness once in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ably improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely beyond the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against one of the first se@@ at@@ belts .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he considered his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Prosec@@ ution Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ leg@@ ged ski@@ ers from F@@ arch@@ s and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the class@@ mates will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle rising up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Lower Sch@@ ar conducted a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle in the hen yard . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and left it out of his chi@@ ckens .
&quot; instead of a chicken breast , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young goat , who wore cylinders to bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for integration , said school leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other kit@@ ten ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ cler@@ k to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by a letter of thank@@ sgiving to colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always ski@@ pped in teaching classes , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick time now is over , declared teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she left her students very reluct@@ ant because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ time regul@@ ators have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control over the free camps and suggest to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose considerable fin@@ es .
the checks are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they should improve the exhaust emissions of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 , and some Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no . the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the power @-@ drive Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has announced to write to every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fits be drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the slopes from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is a massive decline in price of Euro 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; to date , there has been no loss of value for older diesel in the rural area . &quot;
the ace advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored . &quot;
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will arrange a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;

we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker is the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application will fulfill the requirement profile until now . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , while compl@@ ying with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant must show appropriate degrees . &quot;
this is because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the town is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is sure of the office and his employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ hof parking lot are around . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter will beat some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks wait for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city building master . &quot;
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can react very flexibly to many things .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister stresses . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything is over my table . &quot;
&quot; in the event of support and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants himself : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should have completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , excav@@ ation facilities , administration of urban property , urban farm with building yard and city gar@@ dener as well as Unter@@ e Construction Law Office , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : South @-@ rail track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed near the scene .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ bu@@ ster kingdom , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger , and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum would be assumed , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; just under ten people had failed Friday morning , two of whom entered the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to exchange about 200 metres of overhead lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study suggests the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , loss of weight , and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while patients are usually advised to steer clear of meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food are not penet@@ rating into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet of more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus will promote if the same system works with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance by finding that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated , had not . &quot;
&quot; they presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us may protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve prior to the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him be ready sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priorities . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; in this way , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns off : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister , before elections , always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no interference from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important desire of the electoral warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the co @-@ workers from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus continue to observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were deep r@@ ashes .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably ruled , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a party of Gre@@ ens has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony @-@ Saxon Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ops to return their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ owns must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the federal executive and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD Ele@@ ction champion si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ rel@@ ic message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ owns . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD State associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , not more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was the case - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ride , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly . &quot;
comrades in the weeks followed hard lab@@ ori@@ ously .
&quot; then , when they just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he did so pretty much everything that could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival . &quot;
and now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the desire of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden from his comrades in the field of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him go because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is at the bottom of no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ owns . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Madame T@@ owns puts her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party lef@@ tist party in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ owns has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to Parliament by the state list of the Lower Saxony Party in Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins about &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ v@@ res . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; wil@@ le four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties for@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there have been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
subsi@@ dy fees for local core III
anyone wishing to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg Urban Development informed the city development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what happened to date . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been sensation of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renovation projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to also promote the development of the interior , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government president Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros came from the country , the rest from the community sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how does a recovery area occur ?
&quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
&quot; if necessary , the territorial limits could be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the remedi@@ ation area would eventually be set as a statute .
the funding period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however , until September this year , the survey would be carried out once again , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation sector got a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statute of pro@@ posi@@ tional decisions should be carried out in order to begin with the re@@ struc@@ tions next year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot;
the aim is to assess the urban conditions of urban development and decide when remedi@@ ed and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective plot , there is also a remedi@@ ation note in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to his senses and take a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; , &quot; with which it deals with the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing arc , &quot; data about size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating sheet &quot; can only be ref@@ illed if premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first grin@@ ds . &quot;
you can not reserve any subsidies for later . &quot;
&quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were still shown to &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; to the present . &quot;
British inventor converts himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one now has installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , which was left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , vice @-@ president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , a helicopter from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi were exhibited in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the helicopter squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that on July 17 , the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on the South La@@ wn in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to set up US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicopter @-@ units flew additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ ski said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary terms for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokesperson for the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp talked to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ook with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress passed a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the U.S. impetus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of the Russian Eastern Soul Café Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dru@@ g@@ store is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which would really hurt him .
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed at the center of Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s hit series &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Kil@@ ler reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x isn &apos;t over yet . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ gers of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry B@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;

role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld will be taking over food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for by 45 days of the week are eating in the K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz explains . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour @-@ care when children stay until 14 : 00 .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces from 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them for let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz says . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for ital@@ ising to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
this is also about eating healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign exchange for the city . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at some 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the choice process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next elections peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ on said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
&quot; the Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

&quot; according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union would like to check for the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow with managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company out@@ weighed the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s owner , Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years . &quot;
he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch leader of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call to &quot; express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; &quot; In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Mol@@ do@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona be warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for € 89 million . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board is insi@@ sting that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago ?
&quot; as a Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line whereby the Spanish club has expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately dropped off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and thus ign@@ ited in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle kind damage of more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he was driving a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Pass@@ at had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ red the control plan . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard plan . &quot;
Sach@@ impair@@ ment was born on the passenger car .
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it can be good that the mer@@ ced@@ ony driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking for witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ er , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication against the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their false estim@@ ation of what happened at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; , on the other hand , critici@@ zed that the coverage of violence at the cathedral @-@ cats was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doub@@ ted about the attacks in Regensburg that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ ker@@ in and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; strokes had been a normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the memory tape &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high level of plau@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994 : &quot; to summ@@ ari@@ ze , it can be said that in many cases by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many cas@@ u@@ alties greatly appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , E@@ zek@@ iel explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ mann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible for the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a domain record musi@@ cally has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he is just about eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ discovery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can do it at best , to learn from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the domin@@ ating gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all sur@@ vey@@ ors - as literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provides an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always shifted from the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also led to wre@@ ck out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he didn &apos;t just kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key and the sla@@ p on the ground , but also laid ear@@ nest@@ lings and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us that was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state college . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is indeed Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot has been reported about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also report any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of those who were affected , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a du@@ bi@@ ous student formulated it thus : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than against their parents , boarding schools , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their environment , they could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted by any co @-@ worker . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an adver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with that accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , it is kept clean : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the grammar school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful examination of testing , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were victi@@ mi@@ zed and mal@@ adjusted , had all happened at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he didn &apos;t get the boys to the face when they were already at the cath@@ ed@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; as most of the witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ ingu@@ inal gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , combine even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he wasn &apos;t working and was responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently closed the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool continues to practice the punishment . &quot;
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when testing pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , it happened in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows well . &quot;
it was difficult also for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at the time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of assessing the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was f@@ ading in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the past . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear @-@ cutting and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of test death also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ scen@@ dence , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and candy alone you make out of rebel@@ li@@ ous boys no big singers and before any success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , gra@@ cious , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former domains still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ bodi@@ ment , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgiven him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the cathedral cats are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and which they almost glori@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you pre@@ tend to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the insurrection would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had earned great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
