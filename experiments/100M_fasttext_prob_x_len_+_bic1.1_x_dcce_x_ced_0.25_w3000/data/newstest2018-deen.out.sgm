<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An irrational institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former land of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows this, who already had to rain, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a carpet of flickering that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large map became more detailed maps, so-called" "primates" "for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800, during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and issued a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the current neighbours who created the idea of a region covering Bavaria-map were screened."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph moved the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Government of Surveying."</seg>
<seg id="19">The memorial sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison spring / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is sub-sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"it was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a district in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, there is nothing but a field - at first sight: when zooming, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called" Urabsorption, "from which the basic tax was deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the location of the October festival since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at the Gasteig" "or from the" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based District Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II's death."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the Ankle of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk-rent institution in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet at Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt, was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "main square" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs opened many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, urges afro-american travellers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention while traveling through the state and be aware of extreme caution since a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state prosecutions that disproportionately aim for minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have injuries of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped because of their skin colour, they will be beaten or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey and was put into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, showing that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring their deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report of hate crimes reporting the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration infringements, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidefence project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-locality together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the Rotary cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five flats holiday homes."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest Milk "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also chairman of the fishing village BLHV, he described the electric fence project as" "fundamental". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much must be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he did not perform bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the area could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by Leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained twelve 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of soft fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss was firm:" "here, best food is produced." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape splinter line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art fostering of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a material that is marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be enclosed must not be tugable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman Spring project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence, the staggering downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty mockers would have rained him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to its importance, and especially the importance attributed to her, as the famous poem by Emma, Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh apostasy" could be seen better on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus also changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neo-conservatism that brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the United Kingdom's Athletics Championships, Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special develops" "and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh made quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The Middle-streckenner Muir leads along this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the British team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are at the Olympiastadion Berlin again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking criticism on Facebook: do not appeal to a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he was chatting with criticism, for sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led as sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the headquarters of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not water-filled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I was polite that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are more likely to be regarded as a so-called collective use rather than a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's staff referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call other" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical messages or to arrest or arrest protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of papers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter tachographs hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overpowered his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers by George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia to the most eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the MarshallIslands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a" fault "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="380">"in spite of threats and intimidations, the Paniai's victims led a final symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumors to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Jahrbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the hill with the parish church of Tumlingen and the VogÃ © at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a royal court to which the Church or the Patronal Law belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the village picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the noble settlement centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 prove these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, refusing and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This entailed the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two crusts on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius churchyard also served as the last resting place for the victims of Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the church steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower existing today still remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius facility by Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organiser, the friends and sponsors of Tumlinnen invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle, on Sunday 16 July."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="508">"the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones aim to prevent the landscape from being spared.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved the district government due to a lack of form."</seg>

<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no reservations?</seg>

<seg id="739">"the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, where States are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this took place a day after 15 States sued the Agency for the step of step."</seg>

<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: in case of two counterparts, the municipal council of Fluorn-Wintzels decides to set up a common room in the future retirement facility."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden."</seg>
<seg id="750">"although it will still take time until the church community is owned by the church, there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stemming from a private investor."</seg>
<seg id="751">"for this, there is a discussion on a common space."</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the council proposes that such a common room should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorous living, but openly into the church."</seg>
<seg id="755">"as an example, the word" StrickCafé "made the round."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn, by funding opportunities."</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the redevelopment area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"the establishment of a common room would be, according to Tjades, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible."</seg>

<seg id="760">"needless to say, not only Wilfried sole means this addition."</seg>
<seg id="761">"when it helps: unanimously, he passes the body."</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's call points to the many of his own buildings with which one can't move so well, but now you lean into the common room out of the window, she says," "I'm very hard to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a concealed subsidy to any wealth or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsidy, but I get a real counter-value that is comparable in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech."</seg>
<seg id="767">"Staigner's request to split the proposal accordingly, finds three advocates."</seg>

<seg id="804">"Ask St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be complemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"for this reason, a good mobile network reception will play a role in the selection of the location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the star path will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starbase, the viewers experience much worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. "</seg>

<seg id="861">"Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 at the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defensive formation brings in Aue points."</seg>
<seg id="862">"with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, that would not have been the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to go even better in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the tribobox should also be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a gate after an offshoot, the tunics want no more to catch."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the three-toned chain than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," "says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause," because we are in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well, "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many playmistakes in the building."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if one can speak after a draw from a failed start, I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could well be okay," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I first rated the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of a thunderstorm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a career favorites in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know 100% where they are at the moment," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, guests from the Rhineland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we have the claim to come under the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to strike from the start," says Fortunas Chief Executive. "</seg>

<seg id="884">"the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that over 80 percent of the people who have been tested are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) commenced the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum process, they should take a closer look at the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration Board) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was" possibly under 18 years of age. ""</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said the magazine" "The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which" suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>

<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through puberty sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>

<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1094">"on the consumer protection portal www.Food warnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs-batches."</seg>

<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football have an impact on Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organisation controlling the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signed and bring him into a galaxy of other stars in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players but have to counteract with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring its losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which used Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build up a global brand - to become a tougher matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP payment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of EUR 44.4 million."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of SWP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine 60 million euro fine (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs, who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be ambassadors and find such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators.</seg>

<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it held interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members strained in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalised that in the next few years, interest rates would be necessary to bridle the inflation-heated inflation and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets."</seg>

<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it was said that now it is expected that it will provide €15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, since the pressure on the real income of households continues to destrain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required to cool inflation and a" somewhat larger "scale than the markets expected."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that elevations would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>

<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations on a price increase, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% rose to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the end of the year."</seg>

<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years does not" "prevent" "income tax," "but she added that wages at the end of her three-year forecasts will" "recover considerably." ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably last four years until it will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for a interest rate increased since inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, while three policymakers claimed a rise of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) is expected to prescribe 10,000 people"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-sexual preoperative prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered from the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection-prone areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is systematically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"in September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We heartily welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow Minister of Health, said:" the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the dissemination of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot base has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlapping each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an attic where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without having to bend us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"on both ends, a short corridor is mirrored in order to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explained Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, dealing with one of Victorias's biggest real estate investments worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business may be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as" "main operator and the dominant personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record says that Colin has property valued at $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian legacy dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi spoke often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars on leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin was very restrained, although he was a former member of the AFL and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin responded by SMS to say" "I can really not say much", "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict," "he said and added that he still hope for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new staff of staff, met with leading employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to fix: poor information that fell into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media control.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Trump was upset because of fair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince," "said the former election officer Sam Nunberg in February to Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping the Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never find out about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep his anger away from him, then their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, will again and again try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that potentially promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"politico - occupied entirely with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers, to the president for strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on whence they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh" to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof is the forest hotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof located by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the site and already spoke of serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels, with head office in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the Three-Star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"they are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building construction shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings are broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is a lot to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "nicely bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at a higher centre level, emphasizes shearers."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourist Director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's notions are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"looking at the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outer complexes are also placed on the front, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee has recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper noted the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN broadcasted, there are already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin for some time to purposefully interfered with the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation is aimed at several men who acted as consultants of the republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at the private and business environment in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved to the center and investigating whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime crimes and to decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called the Indictators."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite persons for interrogation among Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the broadcaster CNN, pre-charges were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who participated in the meeting had been asked to testify."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. were also Trump counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his campaign boss Paul Manafort at the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that he should act quickly if needed."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a grand jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any actions that expedite the work of the Special Intermediator in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI director James Comey said three times that not to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"however, Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey fired."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have been loud, he wanted to impede the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump has asked him for setting up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, about the late president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"there were two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday, according to which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has loosened the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced on Wednesday by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers large Koloss drives north and will probably need two, three years until he melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg, it is unclear after research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual clashes in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeiture so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this ice cream, the balance of waxes and abuses was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete flock of ice falls down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeiture is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be disintegrated if a piece breaks off at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfeiture is the fourth biggest investor of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it crashes on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"according to scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will be growing again or fall back in the long run and possibly collapsing, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers don't lead the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice-cuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing to be able to handle the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are currently 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and human resources development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term requirements to experts, but to counteract the future-oriented applicant shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and involve a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has it with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is from a real" "competition of the public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"high time to act, so no more jobs remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter colonies, faction leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long ago caused a rotten surprise already in the Cretan's day, when he questioned the personnel costs and startled the rest of the parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a hourly rate," so people. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"as a result, the CDU attempts to pay the employees and officials even better than it actually foresees the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently precisely prescribed, elevations or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Regional Director Martin Richter has a problem: they have too little personnel."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy to aggravate the sound of NGO-migrants lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement about the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all the accusations that are being raised at the moment, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew takes on board dinghy migrants, which are delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1,3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organisation is doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"by now, Minniti states that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in der Nordpfalz in order to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three befriended guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long triad."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"once more, the lookout spot looked at the lookout spot, connected by" "floated" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the open air inhalatorium offer healing brine."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Palatine forest from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in the future, the sports stars will sit in front of computer consoles instead of being sweating through the stadium racing in wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gait included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognized the first federal liaisons who are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is certain," that there are still several clubs on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organizes the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where gamers compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke und Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual soccer players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"in particular, real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to die in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal debt to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football-simulation FIFA are dealt with at the level of competition."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, the pros have long established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and mind nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but acrobous also sees problems:" doping is becoming more and more a topic. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of corporate advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales will be around 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultant writes."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting providers Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot is happening in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobber."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the soccer league clubs according to Dutt are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">Decaying only in nostalgia and clearing old times is no longer enough.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to the negligent killing of Conrad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free up to his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and looking down eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance which they totally regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, which said that there is" no day when I am not deceived by the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer the only person I have been together with since I was born, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, arise yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several news, which she had sent in two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the event.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter in 2007 for murder at her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column, no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while the corpses are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 when President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirer by Riodosia, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Federal Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more traitorous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we are suspicious of all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper" "Riodoce" "in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but for Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of renounced, two-storey mouseboxes for drug kings, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, assumed power-members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in equity holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodosia, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever she led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ-award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoc team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who generously embraced embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you engage with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their insidious start and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells false, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodosia Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - not just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room in which the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the office of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself referred to as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has focused on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the city's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, led through a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows, that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column as the most informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media warder group "Articulo 19" has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>

<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the preserved armored dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodose-dinosaurs living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock out of the square, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy crude oil."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivores, although covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shield technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to better interfere with its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodose family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the pinnacle of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this camdosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been in the Cretaceous period," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal as evidence of his life, including his preserved colon, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodose-dinosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved and scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just put a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous Age was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hanging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the Underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery prize."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.</seg>

<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass incarnation on Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first data of the police, around 17.00 clock between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (county Aichach-Friedberg) were under a storm under 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, interlocked."</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was an easy to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of travel in Munich, a ten-kilometer-long restau formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as reported by an AZ reporter, there was also a massive handicap on the reverse train - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade made a note of the vehicle's characteristics, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is just sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: exhausts.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes an unsuspected or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete card control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus validates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer arrives, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany early next year," "said a railway speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the name of the railway ticket devaluation without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works so: you get into the train, call his ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"for the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation will be published."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the train attendant comes to third place at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" check-in "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticketing through our train guide, you simply check in the DB Navigator."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who go by train often know that next to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest nuisance."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times one has, in any case, one of the contributors not all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling one's own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "devoted to Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that they rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police killed just a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns' lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She started her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive evening later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people shouting, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman said his gun and shouted," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell remembered her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt shivering."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, carrying a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take her with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves in order to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists were awaiting the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new form of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came up to Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt insiders."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, for that is how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrel's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "Blackbeard Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to wear the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmativer type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who fed this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory, since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," It would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a man "(Siggi Betze) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, from which the other stores benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda room with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is this too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why buying palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many store shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle will remain."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, as the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery even manage to distribute all the business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre that stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publicly classified diplomatic notifications about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and landmark dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit some intellectual commentary not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning deliberately sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came out of the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal partners, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would change Chelny's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump fires a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stubborn splits he actually had to fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific glossary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic book."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-on phone in the hand from the United States "disciplinary collections such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they cleave your speech, they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never keep your mouth shut."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), with which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford looking for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nation-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are considered suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as reported by the Cook County Court of Local Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives examine the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K Cubanda, Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago's police authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to localise them," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation to the residents:" "the police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't last long before the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA timetable has been updated in this respect," "explains Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the reestablishment of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian Attorney-at-Law Richard McLaren in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" we conduct the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"RUSADA was excluded from the WADA in November 2015 in the course of doping scandal, from the implementation of doping controls in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it took until the" social media "came to their right," that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line. "</seg>

<seg id="2237">"he secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing his entire funding to $60 million."</seg>
<seg id="2238">"these investments are unlikely to come as a surprise, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital."</seg>
<seg id="2239">"there is a growing complex of research, showing that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before."</seg>
<seg id="2240">"in competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments."</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this business successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn which has both Conversible and Glint. "</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well. companies operate well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">"if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, when a company asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can grow frustrations and motivate employees."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data. "</seg>
<seg id="2250">"for if you don't follow employees," Have you really heard me? "</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"and if you don't care about it, why should I?"</seg>
<seg id="2253">"Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so saving."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"and after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems."</seg>
<seg id="2255">"at Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover."</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23: 00 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their auditors after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center in the morning at 6: 30 am.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real treat for the guys the next three days," said Bruinto-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday was Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted practical exercises."</seg>
<seg id="2268">"in the course of August 18, they will be doing 18 exercises. 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September."</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said he supported the rules of regulation of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous strain on it three or four days, and it's very challenging," "said Mora."</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they just pushed it through, they plunge on, they are great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it really is great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will stop its practices once the camp is finished, as in the light of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already been evacuated with footballs, that will be a protective grid behind a doorpost, will not be an easy task."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"Bruinto players should occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," "said Mora."</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far fetched to think that people rent a room there and then choose to record an exercise there."</seg>
<seg id="2277">"if you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal."</seg>
<seg id="2278">"but we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smite after smoke, because at that time a fire was lit for the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself is there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grub)" seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access only in 2006, when Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it onto the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, cards that represent what was possessed:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all the way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history, among them 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book called 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patron who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"the Smuggler, in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who stage his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell's men solved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise landings."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about heresmen, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which since then has been reclaimed by nature."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2322">"it was like," Oh, now I have to be done again with the damned life. "</seg>

<seg id="2330">But we use this measure to attract your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"and to make it clear, that some things are better than it seems."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in essence, we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honnefer are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"the action is about more than" "just" "a logo and a slogan, it says further."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is important to formulate an all-inclusive promise, one that gives the city a unique selling proposition."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"finally, she is competing with other local authorities."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara on pensioners and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building, as formerly, but in the Prime Minister's seat of office."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the heads of government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the air forces and the navy were removed."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire pull of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, it is negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the coup attempt as a" godgift, "as he gave him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan really has the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unhastening at the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about increasing" "Islamisation" "of the army which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headquarter ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the wholesale failure in the army and security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 prosecutors, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals formerly belonged to the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they appealed to their role as guardians of worldly state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military's power step by step, not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is aimed specifically to advance the Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an unnamed officer, who searched for asylum from persecution in foreign countries, warned that the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and Salafists in a few years. ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this applies, such a development could not leave NATO cold."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of nipples to the type or the colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," says True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" be in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, unsettling one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxxy?" it is said on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumerism."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps through the boundary zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the world in which there is a president in the White House, who has been boasted to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the entwined body and the poised eyes, but how realistic this vision affects."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, at the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no communication or background history, nothing indicating independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the speech of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">How much power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions, which have polarized the US electorate, also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump selfish relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all commit ourselves to bursting our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of Trump, to bring together families."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but in a further context it seems to me that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repelled."</seg>

<seg id="2536">"the place is already written - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years Wacker is the Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that no application will fulfill the requirement profile until now."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, while complying with the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant must show appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">This is because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they cannot fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the town is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens."</seg>

<seg id="2555">Haslachs's own yard and gardener can react very flexibly to many things.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing Stadtbaumeister stresses."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while patients are usually advised to steer clear of meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food are not penetrating into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet of more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus will promote if the same system works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance by finding that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated, had not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given to L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us may protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2672">Anyone wishing to renovate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">"in addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives Steg Urban Development informed the city development on Wednesday."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what happened to date."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"since 1991, there have been sensation of rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was at least 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovation projects are a" success project "- it is ultimately important to also promote the development of the interior, and not only to open up new construction areas."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the government president Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the community sensitivities."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a recovery area occur?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will, as Schindler further investigate, where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the territorial limits could be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "Social City" "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would eventually be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"however, until September this year, the survey would be carried out once again, within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation sector got a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute of propositional decisions should be carried out in order to begin with the restructions next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"subsequently, Pietzschmann explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to assess the urban conditions of urban development and decide when remedied and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective plot, there is also a remediation note in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will once again come to his senses and take a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"this is why there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc", "with which it deals with the structural condition and the refurbishment views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" Household and Housing arc, "data about size, distribution and residents of a residential area can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating sheet" can only be refilled if premises are operated in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be noted, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the" "greyhound principle" "- who comes first, first grinds."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military, which was left to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, vice-president Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in Connecticut, a helicopter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi were exhibited in Connecticut."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the helicopter squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that on July 17, the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on the South Lawn in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you're locked," said the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes."</seg>

<seg id="2740">Helicopter-units flew additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorski said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary terms for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"determining the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates involve personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesperson for the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police are now asking for witnesses of the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter, to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"interview:" "Domspatzen" "report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisner, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "explained after publication against the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false estimation of what happened at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano ", on the other hand, criticized that the coverage of violence at the cathedral-cats was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"no one doubted about the attacks in Regensburg that it would have to be" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said:" you like to go to the church and this is a found fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "strokes had been a normal pedagogical means" "to be finished with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memory tape" My brother of the pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high level of plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994:" to summarize, it can be said that in many cases by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many casualties greatly appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezekiel explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesmann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as choline and perfectionist, which became tangible for the Öfteren, when a domain record musically has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just about eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-discovery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can do it at best, to learn from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the dominating gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all surveyors - as literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger provides an excellent testimony, described him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" intelligible, "as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always shifted from the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his great emotionality, which also led to wreck outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he didn't just knead with chairs and threw the key and the slap on the ground, but also laid earnestlings and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us that was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state college."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, this is indeed Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working zealously."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot has been reported about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also report any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of those who were affected," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students judge Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a dubious student formulated it thus: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd, to assume that... Buben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than against their parents, boarding schools, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that in the run-up to the students and / or their environment, they could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted by any co-worker."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to an advert."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link up its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violence excesses" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking away". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with that accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is kept clean: between the preschool and the grammar school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, let's say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful examination of testing, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were victimized and maladjusted, had all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he didn't get the boys to the face when they were already at the cathedron."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"as most of the witnesses stress, the subject of" preschool "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Dominguinal gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, combine even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so at the most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he wasn't working and was responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymnasium, which even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that in the preschool continues to practice the punishment. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when testing penalties were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it happened in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows well."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult also for him to assess where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" pitfalls of achronism, "i.e. the danger of assessing the past of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was fading in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the past."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear-cutting and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test death also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world transcendence, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and candy alone you make out of rebellious boys no big singers and before any success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of which one can't imagine that he could do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former domains still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his embodiment, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the cathedral cats are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable disrespectful person, to which they still look up and which they almost glorify."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you pretend to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the insurrection would command a 93-year-old man who had earned great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
