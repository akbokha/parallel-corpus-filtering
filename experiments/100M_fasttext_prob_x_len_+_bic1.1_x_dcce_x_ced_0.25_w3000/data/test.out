28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , caught his dream job six months ago as a cook at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shocked and destroyed by his death .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends during this difficult time .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia announced that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment he had a friend , &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to combine his style with his family was to bring us always something to cook , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the exec@@ utable of the SF@@ PD at the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawer
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ ambig@@ uous clearly .
&quot; I will always be put in drawers or glued from outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather snow@@ y . &quot;
&quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend their time at home , in front of TV with loose d@@ ash and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting on 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues visited a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and this was the end of the equ@@ est@@ rian career .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was at all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even dare to take pictures . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Ath@@ lete Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already beg@@ ged him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been sponsor@@ ing its offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master champion was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the winner Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports le@@ es came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP , both Clinton and Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental demand . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a more fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep the situation small in doubt , and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw funding , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; the state has certain duties to fulfil ; it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton speak almost elo@@ qu@@ ently . &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so no internal discussions could come to Tru@@ mp .
the difference in energy and climate policy is more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and drive coal mining in the US again .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Protection Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , explicitly wants to expand and demand renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ ed trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , they do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rage , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp stands who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , is that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of everyday life for women , who flee their own lives . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has laid her small son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the facility along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her flight with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water claim a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it only needs more accommodation for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in housing the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also ur@@ ges women to be accommodated separate from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the rush , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance Speci@@ alists Stri@@ ke : demands for New Work Campa@@ ig@@ ns
assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment opportunities in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called upon its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said it would have been appointed ministers to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to have problems , leading to the fact that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today placed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating working combat measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the quar@@ rels led to the fact that the general practitioners of this year struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract was to be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to proclaim an official end to the war of words and economic sanctions for eight months . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like that would never happen . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was wre@@ cked .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen back on Russia .
&quot; the crime was even greater , as it was committed by a supposedly friend . &quot;
building the ve@@ to again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s territories , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed from his office last month at a failed state coup . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on char@@ ter@@ flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it in this way : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West since it has seen its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ al approach is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state secured a bonus to the fact that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one , as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have been viol@@ ated by the West and are badly treated and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both the pres@@ idents of the press conference said they did not even understand the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s board of directors , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to collapse almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange rate will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the retail store that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to carry out its Six Nations sponsorship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spark@@ les champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British prize at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he put a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori records the jubil@@ ation when he brings the victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have achieved before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fan fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years of winners , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mounting , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence in many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a member of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , became his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Department of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the log manager and staff leader of the director . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state with regard to bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov has long been one of the most closely familiar Vladimir Putin &apos;s , and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would come back on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president - suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - stum@@ bled upon great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you might almost say - to entr@@ ust this position for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be Sand@@ al &apos;s 75 fish , which were spaw@@ ned by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 til@@ ted ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is a future @-@ proof high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men are lucky enough to be alive after they were thrown off by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we let go of water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast ret@@ ar@@ ship and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately remained un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it was released from the person who controls the boat . &quot;
someone is watching over these men today .
badly injured - man embroi@@ dered on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ driven perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he came to her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
the latter then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women re @-@ entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds up cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens think : in the future investors should be taken much more seriously .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 low @-@ cost apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next meeting of the council , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; living concept for living . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is still missing .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas , must assign 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable flats can also be built in stock . &quot;
&quot; but the big issue in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites , but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new housing development programme , which will cost millions of money and must still be financed , is intended to provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; despite this , such as Brat@@ mann , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme is not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of another 1,@@ 300 budget apartments to be lost , whose funding is going to run out over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thou@@ ght@@ fully designed to bring apartments back to the pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the west city , the year @-@ ends meet deadlines . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : that is what the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the western city is again dr@@ astically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing is removed . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; this , though , has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside for playing anymore , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , was compla@@ ining of many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped a little in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or taken prisoner . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the track and jumped for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person dis@@ covers every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after launch of the game , the number of followed @-@ up people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , but only the raw data for improving performance . &quot;
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; themselves 30 minutes time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ elling game spo@@ ilers that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
there has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports just like this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast scrat@@ ched on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es points out on the floating bar during the individual multi @-@ battle event of women in the art gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and the fifth , while consoli@@ dating its reputation , being the best of its generation , or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey to the end found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the sport in the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it awaited them a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after winning gold and silver in the solo campaign of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having planned a long way to the top , never having planned the future , it &apos;s not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led through two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
floating beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she took up again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating deck - and took another 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her end@@ anger - pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book of books became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old clu@@ b@@ team , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after the exercise , she repro@@ ached the audience , over@@ powered by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot dead in the car in a series of mass mur@@ der@@ ers
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous fall of Phoenix while staying in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder would not have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the sho@@ ot@@ ers led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic living areas within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; shared Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself alone on that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , you have embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first reply was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with a help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says she . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminis@@ ces about the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know it yet .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescu@@ es in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ding their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot;
a floo@@ ding warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ stream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still be@@ amed people from floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ by @-@ step that lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford , said that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high @-@ rise of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the han@@ di@@ caps , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , the soil has been greatly su@@ cked by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday . &quot;
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and a lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an associate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ lord of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooded on Thursday , but not reported until now on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; cleared of balls &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police announce that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lung , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was ran@@ ged from bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he will recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , found shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ came the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sockets . &quot;
&quot; so it seems that there were several armed fighters involved , who were very active , &quot; he shared with police Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police is currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police is still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that for more than a reason .
&quot; first of all , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin colors . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is catho@@ lic , makes everybody proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female tur@@ ner was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was jubil@@ ant for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won Gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but gymn@@ astic classes in the whole country do not look like this . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality shows that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts in the first place to be maintained in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these sports clubs are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs to support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; we need to give the municipalities au@@ n innumerable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ astic foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance Doc@@ tors wish to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend additions , in order to improve the maintenance of schedule @-@ related times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ person of the BM@@ A committee for assistance physicians reported last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it is inc@@ iting the current mat@@ ernity crisis and it is used to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; for only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts by the BM@@ A for resol@@ ving disputes by means of talks joined the government for reluct@@ ance to participate , and sometimes at de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this happened to a promise , which Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot;
&quot; should he not do this , then the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything but burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional break , was a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after suggested by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form coverings .
&quot; when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , a blood cl@@ ots can cause blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ m@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness bl@@ ends electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as a cr@@ ushing government report today revealed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former Cab@@ inet member , attacks the police , election monitors and town halls to ignore evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a response king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable inks to a person &apos;s finger when they submit their votes to prevent someone to choose twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the reign@@ ing mayor of Lut@@ on should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the legitimate duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm in the frau@@ dul@@ ent post @-@ election - at which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leader of ID cards to prove identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan &apos;s or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
&quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behavior as a result of &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; considerations regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 Recommen@@ dations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work on letter selection to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social inclusion purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable inks on a person &apos;s finger as soon as they have handed out their voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic mail selection .
prohibition that political activists work full postal sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes from correspondence .
the police have the authority to set up barriers for voting stations .
a change in the law which makes an accus@@ ation easier for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People &apos;s Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in voting stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the choice cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint has been made .
&quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupted and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ in controls &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the border and the band , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only gold @-@ fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games which show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford &apos;s British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theater .
&quot; another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to the same athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities .
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user stated their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet is thinking that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese flo@@ ats have died like a pig
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 100m outdoor pool ech@@ o@@ ed viewers of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; went off as low &quot; &quot; and died during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ ron would give his own opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as he cried , he died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for that .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers around Canada quickly re@@ acted after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eted , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator has just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float in China &quot; has died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show .
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women like this : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the union .
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter got fast and hard at which many asked him to speak
Twitter users did not return when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers for the broadcast and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ ws in the C@@ BC Olympic Games , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry about it . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly picks up under@@ wear in the middle of his business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ tern@@ ed how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back on the shelf . &quot;
she continued rum@@ ma@@ ging and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own stru@@ mp@@ f@@ h@@ osen and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , because they put them back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , re@@ treating and going out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b her that she watched someone - or think about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; How to re@@ think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman took her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday August 9th at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your sk@@ ewer to the sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cru@@ mb@@ les with pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; at attack@@ ers approaching from the front the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the Att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip , before they move backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is best to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and worms of a serious test - by destroying some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k turned his course on a Euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rin@@ se button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before finishing each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aning the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing that he li@@ cked off left more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines , traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to rin@@ se dum@@ pl@@ ings of toilets , the task assigned its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have put in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had liked to lick some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick it and others , with which this was rather difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty ti@@ d@@ bits on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys prior to del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance Sozial@@ wohnung in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social flat after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the H@@ ousing Co@@ operative found property in irre@@ parable status . &quot;
&quot; the walls were cla@@ d holes , wooden boards were pulled up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inflic@@ ted the family had covered street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ fe and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden boards were torn open &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They weren &apos;t talking about anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would meet the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the crowded side of the community house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ ministers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their acts had to be horrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gra@@ c@@ efully approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some of our neighbours , and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial vision . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house &apos;s walls were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ ve tenants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not adhere to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to cooperate with partners in order to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal set in panic after flying a flying military jet beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces placed an incredible pl@@ ough
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a flying jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military airplane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped when they were understand@@ ably beginning to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ drives , without seeing what caused them to come through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane fell on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were stag@@ gering when the airplane came out of the darkness and flew incredible deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the speaker said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where also four people came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke , which limits his vision &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona won the first step on Sunday &apos;s first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ lash climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner needs to do without the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is also missing . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the course of training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was at least clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years now , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; until now , coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen took the lead in most of the other applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test play of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. weren &apos;t really able to convince even at 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ verb@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires to the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven achievements , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot;
Ma Long in an own league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with achievements in World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympic . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ dd@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made themselves the title among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic stop was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between the sentences and in time outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches up to here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said consequently . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that he determined the tempo on the record , leaving Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking ball@@ ots were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had moved to a Ri@@ b@@ bon @-@ last , after that he had to settle in sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have also become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte in similarly high table tennis boards .
Donald Tru@@ mp dre@@ amt of ″ huge problems ″ in the campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , presidential candidate , has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the hitherto republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns reported as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt was false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media shaft . &quot;
w@@ ack@@ ed republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ us in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC Senate , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does not do anything other than telling the truth .
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tru@@ mp continued . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party has threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to attack the Congress more strongly for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ day fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was able to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and has turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship @-@ Vi@@ erter at 800 meters .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan ath@@ lete Michael Rot@@ er was withdrawn from Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls in front of the Rio Games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls were previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commen@@ ced .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya started from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had requested in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type was surface @-@ covering and systematic atten@@ de@@ es . &quot;
Russia athletes were subsequently excluded from summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical won Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra pit under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormously generous man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ osa went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and today they are just as meaningful as those at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , believes that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have been blocking Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the nom@@ ination of Gar@@ lands , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his naked @-@ magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys differ , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he thinks it does the Calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany calcul@@ ates at short notice with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the Union of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the tough pre @-@ accession of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds in the course of months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch of put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees , in their own country , produces refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expul@@ sed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the head of the Association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in the past few months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fire mark as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt himself to Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and saw , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper under calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum grants recognised because of political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 percent of all accepted as asylum rights ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there is no wage for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid as so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the candidates , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come to this : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end votes in the end , only work lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; by September 4 , 2016 , the election and final holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just by the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls . &quot;
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost invisible election campaign , one can see from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when at the wrong time , the right place makes election campaigns . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel Bundestag election circuit lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group didn &apos;t agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , it is crum@@ bling the base that it needs to be very demanding again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ gging behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should create the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the need for holiday and move up their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; is the president of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local vocal ch@@ ests among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , is just talking with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is re@@ formed , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they all made it very jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super @-@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; at the beginning of October , the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as planned , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; it will also be praised for the construction of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of the right @-@ wing drives . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation inside the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from O@@ fter@@ dingen .
the transit traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief conductor Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation project . &quot;
&quot; residents of Bach@@ rut River , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aks sought and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ch@@ ised .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the assembly requested a further strengthening of the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ laps , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself clear about the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been las@@ h@@ ed .
the fastest was on the road with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has gone on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales breaks in them , leaves everyone to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for this . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; the running message is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit it hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; , &quot; the sales revenue has been reduced to &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the road marking has dropped its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt stated on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the advice given , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27 . now , she must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where a little more generous is handled .
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less frequ@@ ented because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive , it is also beautiful elsewhere . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ kli@@ fts return to the end of the renovation work .
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an flu G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being bol@@ ted to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , interior minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was at the results of a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will have a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of cra@@ cking encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and push jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything , which does not have any chances at the co @-@ trial @-@ partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by the Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought into the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the event of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ explo@@ ded and leave questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things , which the people were deeply concerned , could not be cl@@ ung out in election times . &quot;
the focus is on inner security .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly placing their positions on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a great deal between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ant@@ y quar@@ rel about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the chief leaders also demand a bur@@ q@@ a ban and a departure from the double nationality . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling with irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a ren@@ unciation of the double @-@ pass .
we have made an end to the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make it is not reasonable .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ actively shape itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel cau@@ ti@@ ously signals the readiness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it is not in all markets round .
&quot; in the recall campaign , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen embark@@ ed on deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; although Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to gain a plus in the course of the year , despite the diesel @-@ affair , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the VW &apos;s core brand was weaker above all in Western Europe and thus adver@@ sely affected total sales , such as the company listed in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned the weaker figures from July , above all to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there was a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , another minus is added . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected family brand of Lower Saxony already got off lightly through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales increase from January to July .
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not show any deterioration . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car driver turns out a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; warranty &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
reason are legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen is now awar@@ ding its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully comp@@ lied with the editions of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting will not take place , and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers come to a workshop half a year after the retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there is a uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : normal savers don &apos;t have to fear to pay for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us pen@@ alties .
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will be invo@@ iced by the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time he has taken 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now further reduced . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash flow into the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the co @-@ operative association Bayern declared : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear you alone is &quot; &quot; economically not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with criminal interest for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , the chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay blanket fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele endowed with wealth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bench , &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Co@@ operatives Association of Bavaria currently does not know any other banks that charge a compensation for private customers deposits , &quot; &quot; said Spo@@ kes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , stated at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative with private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not like that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before turning to the comment section , in order to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ aven@@ ue of men &apos;s middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widely discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not hor@@ des due to hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest gray suit and shu@@ ffle wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something special like : &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; as a rule , people usually get rid of their collection from the conversations I have conducted in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the contact with the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with it .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; a staff from a pile of pil@@ es fl@@ ushes out .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while stro@@ lling through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produc@@ tively , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; younger people are younger , not older ones who are slowly getting in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , who has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has an entertaining audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ier pop instead of experimental jazz lo@@ aned from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to set when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a window of window than a big buy @-@ in .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives off with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I am trying to bol@@ ster the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; record art &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argue that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions in which persons within the camp offer goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in general and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; over 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimate on Friday that the number of persons living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic Games , cycling professionals Tony Martin will not be enter@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s pas@@ time , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyze in peace the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the Tim@@ ing World Cup in Qatar in October .
I will look at everything we have changed over the last time .

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people watching video games is a giant leap - Microsoft also wants to take advantage of it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the Start @-@ up Be@@ am that specializes in this hobby .
&quot; as much money is spent on the takeover , Microsoft did not share on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am came to the start with his offer only in January , and has already more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up players missions and face enemies and provide equipment . &quot;
the Player Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
&quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help . &quot;

&quot; the start @-@ up employees , who previously located in Seattle in Washington state , move to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt S@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox console . &quot;

here is the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; for example , the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ ces , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary heater to comply with the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days in un@@ interrupted measuring mode ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also capture all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access restrictions at time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; the trailer is equipped with a trailer coupling , according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easily ch@@ ewed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear sweat @-@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic information in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
UK reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ s Ru@@ g@@ by after getting a Fiji Masters class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji had a master class in Handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , After@@ wards , Line Run and raw power to win Gold - her first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independently of that , a 15 @-@ man team would have beaten up in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , R@@ yan lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this key will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
&quot; Fiji began to wonder , and had fun boun@@ cing G@@ Bs from fun . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with only four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a hu@@ stling T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ides by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion resulted in a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still being taught . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the Southern Sep@@ ul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff sounded that the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ us@@ efully beaten in the grass .
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks up in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning in battle with the cancer of the coach inspired to victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ ine gold than in these games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder until the last 220 hard cock , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ th@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who laid such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ x idle use , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female ath@@ lete , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of trium@@ ph@@ al go@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing a batt@@ ali@@ on sticks to willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more advanced than the trainer who didn &apos;t know about 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed with cancer at all . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did that .
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances was the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a thri@@ ving morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning haven &apos;t lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small fr@@ ing@@ ed drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia killed the purpose .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he has now retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the commun@@ es are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for more towns and communities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends &quot; , &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and there have always been new additions since water is the most important food and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association , and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the reduction of nit@@ rate before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia region . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , lau@@ ded Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the blast furnace at church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Board was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner &apos;s partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him I was publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could travel by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t want to provide information about the di@@ version or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special duty command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in the amount of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sour@@ ces in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is needed . &quot;
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the European Commission for the power of power .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions law trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw a mass of steel on the world market in light of its weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers introduce price @-@ dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import steel have an effect . on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry expert Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at the last , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclude closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as the steel trade association on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the set quantity went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mmed study she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors chor@@ us . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , she does something good for her health and her spirit . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly challenge their lungs are not as quick as they can in everyday life .
singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age .
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to lyrics and especially melodies , people who have fallen ill are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a particular performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
concentrating on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; even older people , who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; on the search for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the acquain@@ tance of a senior bo@@ g , you can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet research . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cat on cries of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the throwing of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ ust also left the males no cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the gen@@ itor &apos;s degree of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens found in great distress , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Medical School and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
tom@@ cats also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a herd of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more heated k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when it played the very sof@@ ter k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist told Marina She@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; even during the arrest of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of regular citizens , should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is also not done before football . &quot;
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong @-@ man Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
&quot; according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r will be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the German workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but what unites the Turks , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will arrive in particular to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; Cologne in the past season showed his sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Champions League rounds in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; Lion &quot; &quot; also went out early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ard @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th song . &quot;
this is also the reason for the fans to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; following the attempted coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez escaped only after the coup attempt , not to return to his European holiday due to the political situation in the country . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in order to do so , the storm would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about one @-@ third of his estimated annual earnings of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova should not start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock her start right shortly before the games , was spotted and ki@@ cked off at her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scene : with a set smile , she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience broke out into a jam tower . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial characters in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and former World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit down for a six @-@ month block@@ age in 2010 after the treatment of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don was proven . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had strong dental pains , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ er .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and was closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ powered mer@@ rode . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ rebu@@ ke , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an ) : hardly an ath@@ lete had won so many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised , was awarded due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold favorite has only been tested positive in May but can still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , critics were found to take a forbidden food supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I could leave it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so waste . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explosive charges went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ onation , a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation near the famous beach &quot; &quot; Pat@@ ong &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive charge went into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express oneself about possible motives , but it is likely that the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with Islam@@ ist revolt or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret references to the upcoming stops in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
nor is it clear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police declared their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence in the coming years as well .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , having seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to bring the kingdom to stability and order again . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß , German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
this is why we are now observing the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the national offices during the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists and right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - is extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the substantial increase in righ@@ tist crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be legally @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Liber@@ al group .
&quot; it may well be that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups are formed , which plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; they expressed concern about the fact that many attacks passed into the account of people , which had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seekers have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or the left , which , however , radic@@ alized themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; not always , the Olympic Games or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he could not see any more in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ sburg was subsequently transformed into a viral interaction . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men walk in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of whale &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was ridi@@ cul@@ ed with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s course attracted media attention . &quot;
&quot; an unforgettable one was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to go on alone in a preliminary run over 100 metres of free @-@ style . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ etic at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .
a seat in the front row to the stunning architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a store at the Neue Platz has been co@@ ded .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 p.m. , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tru@@ mp is not as close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election of the US President , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then went on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will be either fli@@ pping , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the mail wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months , whether they are delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ den said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and a shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly , and to make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership acc@@ ru@@ e to dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; the rel@@ ap@@ ses suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ aw that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : following again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management the world @-@ wide number Five of the industry faces a new beginning .
GF@@ K Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already dischar@@ ges from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger , sharing the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Executive Board &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; in the future , anyone who will lead the market research company will be unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in investor @-@ circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders most recently the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced some years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been working at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the same level of the previous year &apos;s quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros fell by 3.4 percent . &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
&quot; during an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; according to her statements , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel agency from Eisen@@ ach , according to her statements , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which drove partly on the reverse track . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident place on the state road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner District of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the deb@@ tors and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ thi@@ cken@@ 3.@@ 44 instead of so far 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.6 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the Office Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , there were sub @-@ coverings for these sewage installations . &quot;
&quot; due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ thi@@ essen , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt outlined the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub @-@ coverings from the previous calculation period must also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; the serious fee increases , Schmidt founded Schmidt with the fact that there are relatively small establishments with a very low waste water attack on all three sewage plants , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs would have a grave impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age restructuring and repair expendi@@ tures , all three systems have fallen to a considerable extent in the past period of calculation . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ thi@@ cken@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be extended , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small sewage plant in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has spar@@ ed the waste water installations over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the sewage @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal can not be extended by these facilities because it is about defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured following the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 0.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting of a Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ flowering , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages get to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting black@@ face promoting or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yellow face &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , having experienced racism , reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely distributed over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and dull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow @-@ face has been dra@@ gged into degra@@ ding extre@@ mes . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , ranging from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ chat &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race , than their older counter@@ parts - could rather assume sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much harder for such things to go un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinions , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible focused on under@@ represented populations and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that they are not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military Operation fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes committee of Congress &quot;
United States Central Command military personnel changed intelligence gathering information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions on site were allowed to report in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the armed forces committee , secret service committees and the military budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering information , typically achieved by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ urs , regularly posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defence Ministry . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence agency published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the high @-@ ten@@ ding demo@@ crat in the committee , Adam B. Schiff &apos;s House of Represent@@ atives , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the moral under analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the White House intervention at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret formations about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time left to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team insi@@ sts that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , since these temporary refin@@ eries have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s dam@@ ned commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA won fourth match in the field hockey team , show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a little longer out of the way the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work place in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder around completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door row in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US &apos;s door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar , which is served by the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have certainly been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsor and feel @-@ good TV advertising when he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the swimming pool and may be there for a long time .
&quot; but if I want to make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely perceived that many of them , I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had been an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it fits for the un@@ enlightened ear matching for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a Ear@@ th@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the car@@ to@@ on trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending up@@ stream - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which it essentially unites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to official olymp@@ ic program according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold medal @-@ hope must go further , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but in television transmission also another high goal : the world or the Olympic clo@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel as a bit ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then downward , then effort@@ lessly upward . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final results of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thropo@@ ids and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male U.S. tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testify that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , expanding into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been constra@@ ined , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ si@@ ghted election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and ar@@ ming themselves again in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of getting Hin@@ dered under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and improved internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government obstruc@@ ts access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered so much to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and business , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is brut@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say he was particularly vers@@ ed in picking up early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special agents to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ aque reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of elections , apparently fu@@ elled by the government according to analysts , and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went over relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently reported that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin cru@@ iser . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can if he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
&quot; it also ent@@ ails his comrades who strive to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having done the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp left behind on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism un@@ le@@ ashes Mr. Tru@@ mp , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls out . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ rau@@ ding the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp received an et@@ ched note , as his survey values continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , therefore , said about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it Hinter@@ rh@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being cau@@ tious about each of his words against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; They cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed over the market price , Café returns to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were sup@@ planted . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
the local inhabitants took it as the last loss in a city of gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ang wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural wonders .
&quot; the café does not serve any beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also replaced by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past , and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave the coffee break for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for bre@@ w with the coffee &apos;s cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took up his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies at Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane brick . &quot;
&quot; her husband , Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ There last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the Re@@ porter ordered chi@@ pper roast , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; men &apos;s teams cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the ways in which the country was surrounded by no longer being a paradise . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ generating food residue , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noted , because chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
peculiar mixtures were tried out because a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even healthy cuisine .
&quot; during her research for the book that also includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man made a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
&quot; like never before or ever , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the eating habits of the country like this . &quot;
&quot; publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als encouraged them to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ eating attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million@@ th heavy man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded edi@@ ble room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stamp an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the dec@@ eption of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Ms Roosev@@ elt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how food could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; They really made people ill . &quot; &quot;
there was the raid in the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e came out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a common trick to give a modest recipe a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped slightly reluct@@ antly a spoon into the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E three times received a supplement .
&quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack on the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector showing him on a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Sy@@ rer a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar &apos;s attack fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ lan@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland &apos;s arks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; anyway from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long ago that Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
&quot; her slow @-@ motion @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine measured her , when she pointed out six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down tor@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably plenty of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; their birth , therefore , was supposed to lie in the early 1960s , when the nuclear weapons tries to tow large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 220 centimet@@ ers of the third smallest animal , the l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , which originates through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to sexual maturity and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such methane em@@ ulations live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was captured in Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal is losing heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; with topics relating to building construction , the Municipal Council has dealt heavily in its latest session . &quot;
&quot; by facilit@@ ating the panel , the Board accepted Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of recently proven housing estates can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ cel@@ eration and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Road weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is nothing more to those interested . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au address young families and sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was said , construction volunteers can now report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also be able to meet en@@ quiries concerning the settlement of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to am@@ end the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the already designated industrial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city of the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt will most benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; until now , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk basket ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund industry , as well as Dublin , will deterior@@ ate in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
the city also points out to be easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the River Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxemburg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; however , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , econom@@ ists say . &quot;
&quot; power relations also speak : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. presi@@ ding judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from damages in the amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other non @-@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on the cost incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to con@@ j@@ ure Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claimed property on laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir traded , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have re@@ conquered total control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the extract of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they delivered more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton made nearly USD 5.3 million in speech records ; the former foreign minister issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his statements of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false talks and re@@ treats with regard to his previous promises to publish his declarations of tax . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp &apos;s special advisor told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax tests were not complete . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mp critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already declared that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations to charitable organisations , his business partner and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already top@@ pled the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp prompt to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she addressed the topic also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades , and to publish his declarations of tax . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , the indications that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama is also supporting the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ mile industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp went to a meeting to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; on average , the Clin@@ tons living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of Clinton &apos;s 2015 showed that these only received USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders ; fire@@ works promote d@@ anc@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which has already had the idea years ago , has intensified its support along with the U.S. natural protection , using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many wood@@ p@@ eck@@ ers used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they can be much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without hur@@ ting the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps comprise the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , mixed with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned towards the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a shi@@ py@@ ard who shoots a fire@@ works fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no neo @-@ construction at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects are taking place by commercial customers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be very competitive . &quot;
&quot; however , the city council now rejected the proposal for the new construction of a sale of the Rhine River near the Rhine @-@ bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine @-@ bank in construction . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new business travelers , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election , as the Arab guests were asking for an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel country selection list .
&quot; the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how did it happen in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the New Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel using its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shock him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be cleared , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some were subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there had been the alleged &quot; &quot; aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed &quot; , &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of herself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction to &quot; &quot; not include Israel into the fast @-@ voting list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung referred to a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police imposed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the participants were gra@@ ff@@ led gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the lifting of sanctions rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador granted . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trading boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Ministry issued approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market falling over in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had per@@ plex@@ ed their faces , demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
&quot; after the raid in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ trail , the perpetr@@ ators must be fled and fled from the gravel parking place located opposite the parking lot with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) should report urgently to the police in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during the summer
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer vacation in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet surroundings of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the zoo zoo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ king . &quot;
&quot; children and supervis@@ ors were treated with their self @-@ prepared corpor@@ ates like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were made , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , there were four stages . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Grand Master &apos;s round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the opening of mercy on Freiburg &apos;s cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and par@@ ted the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster @-@ loved @-@ loved woman stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is started singing together on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers were available . &quot;
at the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on top of that , the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to be climbed for about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again . &quot;
the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse , on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is &apos;s Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the world metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold is w@@ rest@@ ling for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March , despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as hin@@ dering .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Scot@@ sman that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic match in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was close behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , when it went in a higher gear to slow down it and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; from his position as BBC expert , Ho@@ y looked at Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys site , Hin@@ der announced that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won Gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with officers prior to the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition that will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , in the middle of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bling repro@@ aches , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like this , as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt from Port@@ land on the basis of lifting the energy yield question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are on the stake , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , thereby raising all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communic@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy fixed for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects because the melt consum@@ es approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa finished the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melt away of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting system with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told us that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force as of November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this perspective , AG@@ L assumes that contracts will be contributing to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ins@@ ure the supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and 4th daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up With the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , common reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they forgot the cover of their sister and that ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é episode of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris didn &apos;t have to let her other girls participate in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover was concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume resem@@ bling a ribbon rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertising from 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is expected to be so long @-@ awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are se@@ eping through before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , who like &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true of Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success is not pleasing to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but moving around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells handmade pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; district Centr@@ es point 160@@ ,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief agencies will be rejected annually by the municipal government centers , while the sector has been anticip@@ ating the effects of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their quest for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already under full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Municip@@ ality Centr@@ es of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were already dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the resolution of the German government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separation - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can obtain the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centre and its clients , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of being a weapon appointed by staff
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action , after being told that their campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to a staff in February , while they were on the road in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed in Charlotte &apos;s State Court on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted , for months , to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before it realized that &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , laid his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the course in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment was to take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge the judges . &quot;
the campaign made it clear that the media would have ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
Tru@@ mps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
try Philip to contact Philip as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; phone calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the government party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black coalition government could be in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
&quot; according to the survey , the party is only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens were hes@@ it@@ ant despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) back in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
&quot; according to the survey , the opinion of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties was only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are thus still la@@ gging behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return but the pirates would not miss out in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator launched onto the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; computer fair as an &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was very proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has been different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market is dominated by providers who came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for very many people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone , account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telec@@ om companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough in the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success started , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry dominated the market . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ gen now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina orb , responsible for personnel at the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity all over the country not only in our local communities and throughout London .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we are already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces who create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question posed . &quot;
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five year running to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus posted a blo@@ g@@ post where it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ promote advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told us that his desktop page would change the encoding in relation to his advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicator lights the recognition of which part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is underway between the Anglo @-@ American Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of scor@@ pi@@ ckers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertis@@ ers accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue fac@@ ebook ads . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers don &apos;t have an effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared it . &quot;
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; to control people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ aren &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a dull means , which is why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in presum@@ ed suicide bom@@ bed on Swiss Highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , asking these as well as any witness to the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark ran on the motorway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having survived and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to a call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; perfectly extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS researchers Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers share the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co@@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will be immediately looking for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which it requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of Ho@@ ckey &apos;s operations must be coordinated perfectly with the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored as the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and reached the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs in Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume negotiations , set out strike &quot;
&quot; working struggles with regard to wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit down for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were spor@@ adi@@ cally performed on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Infin@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the processing of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; trade unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its counter@@ s in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the UK energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest working disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the Star@@ gate of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates , and in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star names , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; to peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of con@@ stellation win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us about how we want to learn more about how , when and why stars can slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported extensively about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades rot@@ ational rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran out at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both of them , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with a full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hit and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect for years to have received performance @-@ promoting means over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days did not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , got married to the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the pendant at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , the weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wis@@ er ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the chin@@ ese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle @-@ runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the unknown . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the events of more than 50 m of free @-@ style . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be food supplements , &quot; &quot; declared the ath@@ lete . &quot;
according to the report it is said that the forbidden substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
&quot; dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , and Kenya &apos;s nation nation also produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the former tre@@ aties in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion of Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of free style , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de succ@@ eeds H@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators special@@ ise in attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we currently watch a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches was done terri@@ bly in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ duction Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; but where personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , their data will be recovered . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation in the company . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a type of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare their victims using the chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access to accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed by payments of few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to recover their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers are then selling their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware @-@ kits have been created by installing the malware itself , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail will look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set from a criminal and instruc@@ t one more to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment will be made per infected machine .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of firms IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful exploitation , the perpetr@@ ators instead thre@@ aten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the loss potential depends on the type of data still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take on completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all occasions
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it works in no place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant , only the cockpit top falls off there . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
&quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l in case of revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions .
&quot; he is likely to do his job somewhat qui@@ eter , though . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
another engine is available : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because in maneu@@ vering many obstacles are rated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the smart control re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed as needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of aviation , the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee line during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ age was difficult to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the tourists back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family had the view that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er learned about it just before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not violate his duty of information , thus condem@@ ning the sentence . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contamination was found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - are part of the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; after the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot;
&quot; the state must react , and at the same time , react to terrorism . &quot;
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel recruitment of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ sized scale over several years . &quot;
anti @-@ terrorist campaig@@ ning for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon right can be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be preserved according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions how to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of hidden investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the spark media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a ban on Bur@@ ka and the abolition of double nationality previously .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I oppose wearing the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister , who wanted to simulate crime and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act . &quot;
left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to the right bring people no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway feeder
it is regularly st@@ owed on the stra@@ pping road - here is a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal remedy will be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are driving in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam when they travel across the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
drivers can then go straight from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic communic@@ ates early on , thus improving the overall course on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s representative office in Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road@@ way nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ log goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ lo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s height at B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built over three quarters of a year ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load force , in order to include in particular the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated daily traffic jam is prolonged , the provincial governor cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years must be expected : the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ eg@@ esp@@ ur , the state company intentionally selected the traffic @-@ less time during school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic is passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the staging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to facilitate the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds , provides schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most youngsters of the class had come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ gue , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke through the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing Night : tips For S@@ leep Dis@@ orders
&quot; in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep long before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; at least one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aping , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Research and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , for the time being , is the In@@ som@@ nia , therefore an in- and through @-@ sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the sleeping feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German House Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony &apos;s Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can also be found behind it , but also medicines . &quot;
it is not rare that sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is common in a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that various factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advises you . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical stroke tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; doctor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the primary doctor , advises . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of disease @-@ like fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after sti@@ cking , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping alco@@ ve at the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get a grip on their problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws for a better sleep .
&quot; what counts is that regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler reported on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a World Championships and set up his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler , via Facebook , has protected his ex @-@ team colleagues in his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € award and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 € , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night . &quot;
&quot; the handling system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and not even look at dop@@ ing as closely or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , he would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de arrested by baggage theft
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the local police of Düsseldorf police succeeded in taking two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage posts .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants at the airport of Düsseldorf realized a gang which was known to polic@@ emen from last theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were involved in a joint , job @-@ setting and particularly professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had been specifically travelled to Germany for crimes against Germany . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lime broo@@ ks , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; passing the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bike path . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents now have lease contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had expressed himself several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after having been evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on 22 June , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the premises were renovated . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went off under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain before L@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who plays three children here , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increased r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between domestic occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become magn@@ ets for tourists and poll@@ en@@ ers from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on coated pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes make property damage , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ ghty : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga for a long time .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer deliberately moved into the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former holes , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are some people who are not so well be@@ ached , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can &apos;t be seen absolutely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who stum@@ ble over color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who attracts , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain badly about noise . &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the cutting @-@ breaking wool sm@@ il@@ lover , who above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ culous , rather than aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ edge Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes and network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection delivery .
you must submit the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Office of the Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find any private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far it does not work , whether you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings have to be not@@ orious as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Custom@@ ers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centers , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here too , administration and honorary officials are jumping . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can spend time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; anyone who develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there is also problem , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; which some may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; but a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them out completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary officers must look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they are always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
&quot; currently , these are around 100 persons , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8 : 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and struck the bar@@ gain into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; on the occasion of the event , the police set up several pi@@ pers as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the search went without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown persons fell short of the apartment or their escape . &quot;
