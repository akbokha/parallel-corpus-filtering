<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues visited a bit of variety with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop home."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">And this was the end of the equestrian career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was at all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even dare to take pictures."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Athlete Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already begged him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been sponsoring its offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master champion was added to the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the winner Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum of the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports lees came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP, both Clinton and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a more fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the situation small in doubt, and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw funding, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "the state has certain duties to fulfil; it has opportunities to open and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would be increased," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton speak almost eloquently."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So no internal discussions could come to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The difference in energy and climate policy is more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Protection Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand and demand renewable energy with its investment program:" "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transposed trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rage, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump stands who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, is that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of everyday life for women, who flee their own lives."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-frozen women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs set up the facility along with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her flight with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope", "she tells."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour murders, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water claim a sexual act is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, Irish, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to speak openly about what is experienced, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in housing the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone fled women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also urges women to be accommodated separate from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible to women easily, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the rush, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new employment opportunities in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called upon its entire Council to approve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said it would have been appointed ministers to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to have problems, leading to the fact that the contract was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "considering this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Management Board today placed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating working combat measures starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the quarrels led to the fact that the general practitioners of this year struck six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands, and to proclaim an official end to the war of words and economic sanctions for eight months."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrow, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved like that would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wrecked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposedly friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's territories, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed from his office last month at a failed state coup."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charterflights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemsti put it in this way:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West since it has seen its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent resentment on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivotal approach is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state secured a bonus to the fact that after the attempted coup d" état, he demanded support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"it is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glamorous palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that have been violated by the West and are badly treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both the presidents of the press conference said they did not even understand the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a member of Ivanovs since 2012, became his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Department of Moscow International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the log manager and staff leader of the director."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state with regard to bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the most closely familiar Vladimir Putin's, and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would come back on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president - suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - stumbled upon great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you might almost say - to entrust this position for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tilted ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the shutter is a future-proof high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or west side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds up cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens think: in the future investors should be taken much more seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 low-cost apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting of the council, the SPD is proposing a" living concept for living. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Green Party: who wants to build on urban areas, must assign 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable flats can also be built in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the big issue in the town hall is, however, so Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites, but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new housing development programme, which will cost millions of money and must still be financed, is intended to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, such as Bratmann, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of another 1,300 budget apartments to be lost, whose funding is going to run out over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thoughtfully designed to bring apartments back to the pricing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the west city, the year-ends meet deadlines."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: that is what the owners, the housing companies do not want."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, the aim of the so-called mixing is removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few city districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this, though, has focused on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside for playing anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, was complaining of many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990ies (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand dropped a little in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or taken prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the track and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person discovers every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after launch of the game, the number of followed-up people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the company does not know who plays Pokémon Go, but only the raw data for improving performance."</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" themselves 30 minutes time "to" come from the sofa "and" to be active every day "hit deaf ears, because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also gruelling game spoilers that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk around a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports just like this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast scratched on Thursday for a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and" Final Five "team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles points out on the floating bar during the individual multi-battle event of women in the art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and the fifth, while consolidating its reputation, being the best of its generation, or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey to the end found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the sport in the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou bailon told her that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"it awaited them a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a last oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted on having planned a long way to the top, never having planned the future, it's not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will stop as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina led through two turns, the picture deceives."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She took up again with 15.433 on the floating deck - and took another 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her endanger - pure formality - and tears flowed on fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book of books became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago, when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old clubteam, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after the exercise, she reproached the audience, overpowered by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both in Louisiana, will all probability reach record level over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburb of Baton Rouge.</seg>

<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water streamed and flocked in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years she lived there, she never saw such a high-rise of the river."</seg>

<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">"according to Krautmann, the soil has been greatly sucked by the rainfall since Wednesday."</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahua Parish and a lesson in five school districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnasium and that for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin colors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everybody proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female turner was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was jubilant for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won Gold at an individual multi-campaign event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but gymnastic classes in the whole country do not look like this."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality shows that Turnen is a more expensive sport and gymnasts in the first place to be maintained in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are located in prosperous suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we need to give the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastic foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer young high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend additions, in order to improve the maintenance of schedule-related times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairperson of the BMA committee for assistance physicians reported last night in a communication with:" "assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is inciting the current maternity crisis and it is used to treat all physicians."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness blends electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet member, attacks the police, election monitors and town halls to ignore evidence of misuse due to" "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, who is now a response king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elective cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable inks to a person's finger when they submit their votes to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court decided that the reigning mayor of Luton should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in cynical fashion and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the legitimate duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm in the fraudulent post-election - at which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leader of ID cards to prove identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it says:" as proof has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan's or Bangladeshi background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"there have been concerns that... state institutions have deliberately ignored such behavior as a result of" "politically correct" "considerations regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 Recommendations in order to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists work on letter selection to stop" election harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social inclusion purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable inks on a person's finger as soon as they have handed out their voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic mail selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists work full postal selections and envelopes from correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers for voting stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in the law which makes an accusation easier for intimidation in accordance with the People's Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on photographing in voting stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to make sure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the choice cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint has been made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral district has declared Lutfor Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupted and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-in controls" of the elective registration departments of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled her own strumpfhosen and pants and tried them."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your skewer to the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker crumbles with pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"at attackers approaching from the front the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the Attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and beat the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip, before they move backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and worms of a serious test - by destroying some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk turned his course on a Euro ticket, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before finishing each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaning the rinsing button of a draw toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing that he licked off left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines, traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings to railway stations to rinse dumplings of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their Luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands are of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" this comes close to the worst thing I have put in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film director, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had liked to lick some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick it and others, with which this was rather difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty tidbits on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asoziale family left her social flat after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the Housing Cooperative found property in irreparable status."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were clad holes, wooden boards were pulled up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inflicted the family had covered street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strife and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease was in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiance was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They weren't talking about anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would meet the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the crowded side of the community house, trash and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant administers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as a delogization is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their acts had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have gracefully approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope that this development will give comfort to some of our neighbours, and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogization on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to sweep waste mountains surrounded by the house</seg>

<seg id="35">"Skeldon received a fine, after having found guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial vision."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house's walls were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delve tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall said that Delogization is a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not adhere to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who were harmed by such a behavior," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee was able to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary told that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 metre runner Ferguson Roter."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"IAAF World Federation has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, shared an IAAF speaker."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IOC, IAAF will evaluate an assessment," said the IAAF explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and has turned out to be Ferguson Roter, the sample delivered and signed," explained Kenias chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Roti was in 2015 in Beijing World Championship-Vierter at 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">"four days before, the Kenyan athlete Michael Roter was withdrawn from Rio Games."</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about pending doping tests against money payments from his country.</seg>

<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time at IOC after numerous doping offences.</seg>

<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, the WADA Kenya started from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA."</seg>

<seg id="4">"a musical won Salzburg: the" West Side Story, "Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece."</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar orchestra pit under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel:" this music is full of rhythm, "he enthuses."</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">"in this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria."</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>

<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously generous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS died in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had decided to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not suit himself and Erdogan praises, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-Stiftung Dialog and Welt, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany calculates at short notice with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it might even be" "some hundred thousand", "believes the president of the Union of Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the tough pre-accession of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had outstripped Kurdish strongholds in the course of months, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the putsch of putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees, in their own country, produces refugees," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expulsed over the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the Association called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, there is a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for the first time in the past few months, I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire mark as Gülen-Pendant destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not adapt himself to Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and saw," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-Stiftung Dialog and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the newspaper under calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum grants recognised because of political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"at the reporting date June 30, this was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all accepted as asylum rights (39.625)."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in this survey there is no wage for war, poverty or lack of perspective."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid as so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the candidates, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come to this: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and end votes in the end, only work laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"by September 4, 2016, the election and final holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just by the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost invisible election campaign, one can see from his large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" "We create" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, when at the wrong time, the right place makes election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel Bundestag election circuit lies in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group didn't agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU waives the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that in the country, it is crumbling the base that it needs to be very demanding again to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing:" they have to go where it hurts, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is a lot in the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were lagging behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, should create the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the need for holiday and move up their campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," is the president of Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green campaigners embark on a search for local vocal chests among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just talking with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is reformed, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they all made it very jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super-team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of October, the construction site could be relocated to the south as planned, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it will also be praised for the construction of those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of the right-wing drives."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation inside the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transit traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the deputy chief conductor Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation project. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"residents of Bachrut River, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaks sought and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas franchised.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the assembly requested a further strengthening of the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overlaps," "says King, who made himself clear about the situation himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been lashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 hourly kilometers in the speed-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has gone on, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales breaks in them, leaves everyone to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for this."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop", "but also admits that" "of course" "the running message is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have" hit it hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 percent", "the sales revenue has been reduced to" far over 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road marking has dropped its operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt stated on a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the advice given, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. now, she must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where a little more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all complaints, Göhner is sure that his host will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715 and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests are now less frequented because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if one cannot drive, it is also beautiful elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-klifts return to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu Göhner keeps the effects of B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was at the results of a" achievable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière will have a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things have already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second trial for proposals that have not been made with the SPD: he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and push jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything, which does not have any chances at the co-trial-partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by the Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the event of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unexploded and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things, which the people were deeply concerned, could not be clung out in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The focus is on inner security.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"yes, there are election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the Union and the SPD are increasingly placing their positions on the subject of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a great deal between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garanty quarrel about the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the chief leaders also demand a burqa ban and a departure from the double nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling with irreconcilable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a renunciation of the double-pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have made an end to the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To remake it is not reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a Burka prohibition he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutionally unconstitutional and whether it is actually" "reasonable" "for the coalition partner, must first show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things that could cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to proactively shape itself on the subject of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="2">"despite diesel scandals, the delivery figures are rising worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="3">But it is not in all markets round.</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Germany's home market, deliveries declined by almost a sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">"sales manager Jürgen Stackmann returned the weaker figures from July, above all to two sales days less in Europe."</seg>

<seg id="13">"in addition to the situation around the attempted coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote for the exit from the EU, explained a spokeswoman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the USA, where the fumes first escalated, another minus is added."</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">"all in all, the mainly affected family brand of Lower Saxony already got off lightly through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available."</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulating exhaust gas tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, Volkswagen is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of the retrofitting, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after retrofitting the vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not show any deterioration."</seg>
<seg id="23">"after retrofitting, the car driver turns out a" "guarantee" "certificate, but does not speak of a" warranty "as it was said on Friday in corporate circles."</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason are legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the" Focus "had reported, Volkswagen is now awarding its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "VW has fully complied with the editions of my Inspection Commission and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from this are not accepted," "stated Federal Minister of Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry."</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the warranty that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after retrofitting will not take place, and all type-relevant vehicle values remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen himself uses the term" "warranty" "but not as it was said in corporate circles."</seg>
<seg id="32">"with the wide term" warranty "Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, customers come to a workshop half a year after the retrofitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"also in the interest of customer interest, it is important to avoid that in any other damage, which has nothing to do with the scandal, there is a uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before turning to the comment section, in order to sow it under the pseudonym non-avenue of men's middle ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the widely discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes due to hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and shuffle wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something special like:" "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"as a rule, people usually get rid of their collection from the conversations I have conducted in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contact with the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" a staff from a pile of piles flushes out.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while strolling through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently and said," "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productively, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"younger people are younger, not older ones who are slowly getting in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, who has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexier pop instead of experimental jazz loaned from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to set when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window of window than a big buy-in.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives off with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I am trying to bolster the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">"it is pure" "record art". ""</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research shows that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, are not considered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the strolling through plate-shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the startling view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argue that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions in which persons within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in general and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"over 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" would be a catastrophe for these children of which the youngest are eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimate on Friday that the number of persons living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji had a master class in Handling, Side-Stepping, Afterwards, Line Run and raw power to win Gold - her first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but independently of that, a 15-man team would have beaten up in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, Ryan lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this key will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Fiji began to wonder, and had fun bouncing GBs from fun."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co., as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with only four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hustling Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athlete jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presides by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion resulted in a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still being taught."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they ruthed to the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, who laid such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances was the right term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the amount of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Sources in the existing systems for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday Edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a certificate agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is needed."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission for the power of power.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions law trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "stated IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer in China threw a mass of steel on the world market in light of its weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers introduce price-dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties on import steel have an effect. on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry expert Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been more stagnant again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at the last, ThyssenKrupp didn't want to exclude closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, such as the steel trade association on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the set quantity went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Singen has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehrammed study she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors chorus."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"incidentally, she does something good for her health and her spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge their lungs are not as quick as they can in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age.</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"due to lyrics and especially melodies, people who have fallen ill are sinking to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a particular performance is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating on one's own voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"on the search for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the acquaintance of a senior bog, you can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">Tomcats also react to the reputations of kittens - but always the same.</seg>

<seg id="8">"she is the author of the study, which was published on this Friday in the journal" "BMC Evolutionary Biology". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous study, the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens-screams differ with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the MHH animal husbandry.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a herd of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more heated kittens, which were additionally lifted up."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," said Konerding. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeaker when it played the very softer kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be innate or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>

<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the Office Office Kulmbach, there were sub-coverings for these sewage installations."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welthiessen, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt outlined the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or sub-coverings from the previous calculation period must also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the serious fee increases, Schmidt founded Schmidt with the fact that there are relatively small establishments with a very low waste water attack on all three sewage plants, which lie between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"due to the low distribution basis, for example expenditures for necessary repairs would have a grave impact on several thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age restructuring and repair expenditures, all three systems have fallen to a considerable extent in the past period of calculation."</seg>

<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be extended, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurde."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting of a Roy Lichtenstein."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-flowering, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting blackface promoting or white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "yellow face". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, having experienced racism, reminded the filter of injurious clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, was that the filter was" "hurting and dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow-face has been dragged into degrading extremes."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, ranging from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race, than their older counterparts - could rather assume sensitivity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user," it is much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "said the chinese Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinions, a complaint that the Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible focused on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu, on the other hand, said she will leave her Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users than us to say that they are not O.K. "</seg>

<seg id="2">United States Central Command military personnel changed intelligence gathering information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions on site were allowed to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the armed forces committee, secret service committees and the military budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering information, typically achieved by high-ranking CentCom commandeurs, regularly posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, CentCom was publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway through the General Inspector of the Defence Ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence agency published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the high-tending democrat in the committee, Adam B. Schiff's House of Representatives, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, Mr. Schiff," delayed the release of intelligence reports, "damaged the moral under analysts and" gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the White House intervention at the Centcom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who were taken up after complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret formations about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the divisions of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time left to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, Mr. Hooker's team insists that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these temporary refineries have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms's damned commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Briton on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer out of the way the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in his hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they missed the Olympics in 2008, as they could not qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things for better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work place in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder around completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door row in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US's doorkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar, which is served by the wristband to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a women's black with dimples, could have certainly been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsor and feel-good TV advertising when he was a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming pool and may be there for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I want to make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely perceived that many of them, I had asked, didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had been an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it fits for the unenlightened ear matching for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a Earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of his never-ending upstream - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling motions (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to official olympic program according to version, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold medal-hope must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but in television transmission also another high goal: the world or the Olympic cloak."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as a bit tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly upward."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final results of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his to air, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testify that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months protests against the government shook the country, expanding into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been constrained, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to exploit the turbulence and arming themselves again in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of getting Hindered under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and improved internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered so much to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of time, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is brutally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly versed in picking up early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands of elections, apparently fuelled by the government according to analysts, and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went over relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently reported that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin cruiser."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republican if he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also entails his comrades who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having done the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump left behind on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism unleashes Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on falling demand values to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said," Of course I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction falls out." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defrauding the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump received an etched note, as his survey values continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologise for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani, therefore, said about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it Hinterrhänkler, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being cautious about each of his words against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," They cannot!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies at Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane brick."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband, Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COThere last book" Chop Suey "was the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while bricks were told in their book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the Reporter ordered chipper roast, this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," says Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men's teams cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the ways in which the country was surrounded by no longer being a paradise."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central, tense theme," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseries became staple food, the casserolle as a" wonderful way of regenerating food residue, "brickman noted, because chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures were tried out because a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even healthy cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book that also includes recipes, brickman made a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular supplement at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"brickman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the family recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or ever, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the eating habits of the country like this."</seg>
<seg id="33">"publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and periodicals encouraged them to become" "housekeeping politicians" "and the challenge of converting Pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Me-Cake-eating attitude, are particularly tasty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlanhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's arks only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "anyway from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long ago that Greenland hairies become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland hairies are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her slow-motion-turpentine measured her, when she pointed out six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers down torches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably plenty of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, was supposed to lie in the early 1960s, when the nuclear weapons tries to tow large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the case of 220 centimeters of the third smallest animal, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Grönlandhaie had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, which originates through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to sexual maturity and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland haie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methane emulations live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose speck at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was captured in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal is losing heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"thus, the city of the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly probable that Frankfurt will most benefit from Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field's financial markets and real estate markets of the IW. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether monetary houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU."</seg>
<seg id="5">"until now, approval in the UK is sufficient for the so-called EU passport."</seg>
<seg id="6">That is why big US banks are taking advantage of this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to store jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the lobby association" "Frankfurt Main Finance" "anticipates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for Frankfurt, such as the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the risk basket ESRB."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"at the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the River Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch in St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, there were four stages."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the registrants in two years, the Grand Master's round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the opening of mercy on Freiburg's cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern were on their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and parted the pilgrimages."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster-loved-loved woman stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and text texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis started singing together on field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from a specially arranged pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parishes of the local parishioners were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="15">The earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse, on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March, despite the resignation of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as hindering.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner made an Olympic match in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was close behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy change made a major part of the transformation, when it went in a higher gear to slow down it and make it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from his position as BBC expert, Hoy looked at Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys site, Hinder announced that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we have come so badly with so many world titles, that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on security."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with officers prior to the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition that will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director, in the middle of sexism and bulbbling reproaches, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like this, as if the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt from Portland on the basis of lifting the energy yield questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are on the stake, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract, thereby raising all supply contracts as the supplying energy company communicates."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy fixed for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects because the melt consumes approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa finished the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt away of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting system with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, told us that three more owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force as of November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this perspective, AGL assumes that contracts will be contributing to revenues in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to insure the supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a statement of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [current market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator this would not be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and 4th daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up With the Kardashians-like?), common reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister and that ends with a classical twist: they all have a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is the cliché episode of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris didn't have to let her other girls participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashian began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's great sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover was concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a volume resembling a ribbon rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were advertising from 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the unveiling of his cover star is expected to be so long-awaited, that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are seeping through before the official announcement."</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been more" celebrities, who like "models, the celebrities" on the cover. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls below the previous category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything is true of Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners success is not pleasing to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But moving around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estée Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells handmade pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator launched onto the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the" "Cebit in Hannover" "computer fair as an" "office in the west pocket". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator."</seg>

<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has been different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by providers who came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for very many people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity all over the country not only in our local communities and throughout London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we are already 10,000 new apprentices who create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrows is too large."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fishers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question posed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five year running to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the dark" in an act of despair "on the road and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49, who was attacked by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, asking these as well as any witness to the incident to sign up."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark ran on the motorway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after having survived and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus is exposed to its day-side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS researchers Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates, and in what connection the rotational periods are associated with planetary development."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star names, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"to peak rotational rates, these ripping stars encounter large amounts of constellation winches."</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide succeeds Hacker her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackmail ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently watch a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attaches was done terribly in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptoduction Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, their data will be recovered."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in the company."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigates the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare their victims using the chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access to accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed by payments of few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to recover their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="29">The programmers are then selling their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known among many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of firms IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomware to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful exploitation, the perpetrators instead threaten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in this way, the loss potential depends on the type of data still much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerkonferenz defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it works in no place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off there."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l for high-level and 1026 l in case of reversed back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the luggage compartment can be loaded easily, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he is likely to do his job somewhat quieter, though."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top version "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates, because in maneuvering many obstacles are rated as" approaching objects. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttle the speed as needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, diesel from 23000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips For Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep long before the wake-up ringing."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at least one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weaping, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, for the time being, is the Insomnia, therefore an in- and through-sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the sleeping feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German House Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony's Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychic or behavioural factors can also be found behind it, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare that sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is common in a depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there's an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, advises you."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look very different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical stroke tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"doctor Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the primary doctor, advises."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, for example, in snoring with respiratory problems, in case of disease-like fatigue, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after sticking, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping alcove at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on their problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"what counts is that regular bedtime and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred in recent weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the residents now have lease contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin interior senator Henkel had expressed himself several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after having been evacuated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrol three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the premises were renovated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went off under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain before Late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mostly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increased rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection from vandaliating left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between domestic occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become magnets for tourists and polleners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on coated panes or freshly painted facades that were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes make property damage, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer deliberately moved into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: faceless newbuildings in former holes, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are some people who are not so well beached," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can't be seen absolutely." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who stumble over color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the cutting-breaking wool smillover, who above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less ridiculous, rather than aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"we were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-edge Wollmilksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes and network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection delivery.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must submit the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of the Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find any private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it does not work, whether you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community dwellings have to be notorious as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Customers and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centers, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and honorary officials are jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can spend time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"anyone who develops the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also problem, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says clearly, "which some may call naïve." but a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary officers must look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes clear that the Urbach is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are around 100 persons, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
