Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal signed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with regard to the election in Israel that was im@@ minent . &quot;
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat sad voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled for 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all @-@ all employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police caught him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were jo@@ king in his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background . &quot;
&quot; he himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a ple@@ ur@@ ning for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the doctorate , which had worked so hard for the Lamb , would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the universal &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb did the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called his wife Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor force for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but toy and baby products dealers say that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with application talks this month , and the number of employees rising from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees selling , sending and delivering products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated crow@@ ning and a leg length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time @-@ travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the margin of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban calls on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
of course it &apos;s too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let her dollars flow , in order to pl@@ unge him . &quot;
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of Tru@@ mps revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; just two out of 10 , they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in things enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , &quot; said ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first electoral state , I@@ owa State , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they put up their hon@@ orable hats , Republi@@ can voters consider Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; however , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters consider Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign to be plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the shri@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters support Tru@@ mp , say that they have firmly forgiven their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; ever since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration was the shooting and fishing point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp is apparently also doing it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a floor roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; stated in the study - therefore , the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter most costs .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top rated locations , however , one of the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two tw@@ ins in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern in the witch @-@ dron of Pi@@ raeus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the champi@@ ons League in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to rub@@ b@@ ish double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; Müller received at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership gra@@ cious assistance of Olympic champion Roberto , who caused a f@@ lange of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; said Bavarian @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shining . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent 6 home games in the King &apos;s class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ously to work with their aggressive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced to the left outside Douglas Costa , which rarely happened against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller showed more luck to the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; first of all , as Olympic Games @-@ stor@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown beat the Pole &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians always played their dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could bet needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er it was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made it all clear 13 minutes later . &quot;
before the game it came to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of f@@ m@@ ished Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus using words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : in case of ren@@ oun@@ cement , the risk decreases rapidly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fa@@ xes . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; tooth decay causes cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last for more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained the author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health down to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of unemployment is affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it has already been known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman of goods cap@@ tures
&quot; after a young woman is brid@@ ged at the station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ leys @-@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; &quot; station , the federal police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning around 1.@@ 40 clock , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a train from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by collecting the train , the Federal Police provided the he@@ avi@@ est injuries . &quot;
she was given emergency treatment on site and brought to hospital by rescue staff .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ gh@@ tly railway crossing of the young woman , no findings are found to the officers . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have perceived acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; the residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ wer@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8@@ s or any other police station .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning is much more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade area is to emerge with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new arbit@@ ration court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; until now , the parties agreed to each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens have not trusted the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there may , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) requested especially by major corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , where companies can take damage compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; above all , it has been critic@@ ised that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission took key points into account in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association Business Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic potential of the economy through too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) were concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they arose and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative writer . &quot;
&quot; the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever@@ ly composed songs , which harmon@@ i@@ ously nest@@ le very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a series of dar@@ ede@@ vil@@ s : each of the 50 US states should follow . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois , &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot;
over@@ bor@@ dering ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any record list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic references . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs have gone up , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and great fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
&quot; in the glo@@ omy ham@@ burger , More ! &quot;
&quot; it mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens became clearly more mature , returning to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only at an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tions
&quot; ever since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut was eag@@ erly awaited at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and for the first time put himself in David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after mid@@ day while his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , spark@@ ed criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s Political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of wins . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to cut the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy , says that he has ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle that the shadow of economic ministers will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &apos;s theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works , but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the frac@@ tions with the Prime Minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdict of a leader and his position among his members of parliament , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound asc@@ ends through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid for SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and raised estim@@ ation over the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index rose by 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by buying stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the Shar@@ es of the Mon@@ di Packaging and Paper Group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sold his estimate for the company R@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports climbed by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages risk expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill &apos;s managing director says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with top @-@ lay@@ ered fr@@ ise . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euro heavy .
rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 rot@@ ates through .
how to Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live i@@ dol , whose poster is hanging in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs as much a day as her mother E@@ wa deserves half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; that says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot;
school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber does not .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising blu@@ ep@@ rint of the Super@@ chim@@ e he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p company donated many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber is also cas@@ c@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is astonished at the window . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , who is supposed to follow his fourth album in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings the Lebanese to potato @-@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; these are both - in the potato th@@ row@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ e instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have been put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue is spinning in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the idea has been given to the Lebanese in the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay wants not to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary understanding comes well . &quot;
met@@ a starts ground @-@ breaking campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food vendors and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; further details of its defense strategy will be published on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual Invest@@ ors Strategy Day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ isch provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and remove all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in WA and 30 in WA over the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ eth said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA purchases are the most faithful ones . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operative debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , are resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week , and to supply I@@ GA retailers with faster @-@ growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an are growing and hopes that in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented du@@ os , who is often called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious clas@@ h of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon afterwards , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison called out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ ing sh@@ ook a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite en@@ gros@@ sing is the fact that , in my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the fight , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player who has thrown a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so forth , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take it into account during the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ burg &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has done very fast the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and advised the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants attacked themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian civil servants with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people , who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the migrants gu@@ essed &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot;
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a str@@ it@@ eful meeting in Brussels did not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not impose its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency decre@@ ed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having ended a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and become an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Inter@@ im Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to get there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders just come back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has pl@@ ung@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the country &apos;s democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would love them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common response is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the sel@@ ect@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to vote , who would be their second choice for the party , is bi@@ ds at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half said that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with jum@@ pers in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; percentage has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features with voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it hasn &apos;t affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting holders see Tru@@ mp as honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tru@@ mp with the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l falls to the two candidates , and others are losing dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers across the country . support is growing by 23 % in the final C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey . &quot;
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passing Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in the third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was executed in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp much ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees in the top , 23 degrees in France . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a complex ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were submitted to five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood were brut@@ ally attacked by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , leading to his death , sharing the police . &quot;
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target about a frozen field .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headache , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call on the call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and re@@ port@@ edly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with dull force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the sh@@ kan@@ es every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for Mor@@ ning &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a criminal attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ countable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise raise will come , and the house will be shaking , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have emphasized so sharply that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases things can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that net income proceeds from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob Dol@@ l , chief asset strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally appears later in the enhancement cycle and the return on return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , only nominal GDP was less than 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all under@@ growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ aire very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a price increase , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the boom cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer cooperation between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; what is interesting is , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have increased , and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit from this if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial investment increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet exceeded the average balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers want to see gains through higher returns , even if experts in different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the station for its &quot; &quot; contemp@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated the Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples , in which you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that &apos;s really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er was needed to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice to - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million pounds . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has bra@@ ked the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there is now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developing , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ ing itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will withdraw their purchases prior to this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers got around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers web sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the shop@@ pers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending has been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now being conducted via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia in part places the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane plum@@ met@@ ed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried across the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay off their respect , when the first of the dead took their final journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a construction crane went through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell to the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung over the construction company of Bin Laden due to the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the bodies of 29 men who were killed when a crane plum@@ met@@ ed through the Great Central mo@@ p of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane was not to be stopped when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was jointly responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was able to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ressed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mosque as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sli@@ dden Son , which was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded . &quot;
other users get half of that amount .

&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at arti@@ sans and close 60 selling points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women to deal in B &amp; Q shops because eight of ten purchasing decisions were hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , which are more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this more towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British partner listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group trained the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht Kla@@ gen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball field runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be held responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public spending . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel found out that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants were allowed to use funds from the association &apos;s accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial offen@@ ders .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence declared that at no point in time the association had emerged as an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would only have compensated for reimbur@@ sement and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we further or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ making profession of the financial officer , told us . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , put our life insurance under@@ tak@@ ings as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the inspection . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , only debts must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success , the payout of the expense indem@@ ni@@ ties had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump sum and non @-@ detail entries seemed , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and accounts recei@@ v@@ ables administr@@ ated the two defend@@ ants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for financial support , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in the year 2011 against the one functional investig@@ ator because of the abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent refused to answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim indem@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
why indem@@ n@@ ity ? we wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him all of you are of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never moved a cent salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged the club 1,000 euros per month . however , the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to show accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an operational test , in which everything was judged as correct , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also had a mil@@ eage .
&quot; he explained in his statement that all the exercises had to be done in cash , in order to do so from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard runs another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel reduction that has been ongoing for the past three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build further jobs in spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the stops at the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , sharing the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will start from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 HP employed around 30,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard share gave 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has been a large group of printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently developing : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led even more in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , continued to use the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with spl@@ itting up and massive stops for change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and getting more and more stores online . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ mans restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total of 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rejected : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 per cent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; co @-@ operation with the Syrian rulers , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , declined 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 per cent . &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break@@ up of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police a police line was formed and a water designer was station@@ ed behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set off pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now waited for a while .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees wal@@ lowed in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero @-@ area and starts a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Associ@@ ate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less steep outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; mort@@ g@@ ages at Delta State University ap@@ ologi@@ zed for ap@@ ology , &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; to make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said that he had shot on a man , and he was put to death . &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles traveled to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a clas@@ h between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was no information , no evidence , for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who stated that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car aside , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ blue indicates on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ rov@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the worldwide approximately 1,000 executives will cost the work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evaluating the low @-@ cost of Eu@@ rov@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided by the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is not a member of the Board of Management for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ rov@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ rov@@ ings at the executive board for chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines were operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the Pilot Association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the first strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come as quickly as possible to yiel@@ ding results . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the union and airline conflict has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the concept of &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United won &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left field defen@@ ders to cry and shut it out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the han@@ ger of an El@@ f@@ tier .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had wander@@ ed .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w , at the defeat of PS@@ V &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a burst of leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ el@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is doing very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead , re@@ produces an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reading . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron partially reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment by the cov@@ et@@ ous , trees f@@ ading , thin @-@ bear@@ ded creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circus .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not finish a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ ep players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , when he strikes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer I highly en@@ record .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least equal opportunities received before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may have not done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he started as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the cad@@ res , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cub@@ icles , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;

&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule . &quot;

Bre@@ x@@ it = Bre@@ x@@ it = UK exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is into a dol@@ drums until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ ev@@ oc@@ ated ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely crushed for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at &apos;s friend said recently that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU now , is not always full of own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive changes in contract that they often do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it end@@ angers the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened with the exc@@ essively long expos@@ ures like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may deliberately not intentionally plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they are weak to remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
&quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I always express it in a friendly way , in the development . &quot;
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ac@@ eous Ten@@ dency and the wild relatives of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their closing ceremony on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Cameron does not give free map for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin be wa@@ sting political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et , critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed references from BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funding from an E @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing it should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the session .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ ers signs &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ Fin@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ Fin@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and from channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed programs which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ Fin@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I need to see how this public television is supposed to be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC in general .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series production from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows will reflect what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like East@@ Fin@@ ders should be selling . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where pretty much the audience can &apos;t measure , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by turning on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the worms showed the power of a new technique called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ o @-@ hon@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be revealed at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed about advertising for the arms trade - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and shady corporate advertising , but &quot; the blu@@ stering with bright colours and animation will stick stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the belief of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Years , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; sincer@@ ely said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I &apos;ve used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comedy of con@@ vivi@@ ality is worn out - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and at the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the word . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something to make drums &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ ci@@ d music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally enter into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse to take part in it , dis@@ connect and then see it every day and perhaps experience how she pul@@ ls together all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not closed room , the border between an ultim@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety by plu@@ gging - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ parent , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot;
the real estate business owner Markus Gil@@ dner relies on town@@ houses in central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the needy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds up town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushed to the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ ds : a town@@ house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs .
what is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; I made my project properly . &quot;
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulations .
sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is still under@@ stated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were some , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the needy . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build even today cheap and well .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to be able to do so by using a special tool , del@@ eting apps and re@@ installing them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half way and lead to a break@@ up of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup World Cup marked the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion from the second race in Singapore on this Sunday from the title defender and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and also attacked the floo@@ d@@ lit grand pri@@ x in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; club , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the 1st class and honorary citizen of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , who accepted the chairman Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record players who cannot get the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
neighborhood office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Old People &apos;s Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office recently opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , senior citizens and advice seekers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health care insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ ses are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not only will there be a lot of benefits for the insurance companies , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offerings from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis offer an ideal complement .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this is because this is a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ scored at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at age : &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus commented on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus won an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna . &quot; &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was appointed to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the renovation of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz Palace . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not listen to it . &quot;
&quot; Wiese was able to cut the hair in the middle of the city , when he saw how outside a parking guard stood out for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; the meadow then stor@@ med out of the store , insul@@ ted the police and repro@@ ached her the fake money @-@ sentence in front of the feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only afterwards will I decide whether a meadow will be shown , or not . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witness the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , following information from the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the group was at the height of the fuel station . &quot;
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the youth , and struck the face with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed him from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the last young man was brought home . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home , and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there . &quot;
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male .
&quot; by means of a head@@ stock , the victim went on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; so far , only one vag@@ ue bag description is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been around 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , his husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested some 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her medical education at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice in the year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of having his own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they are still living in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there , the double family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed leading emergency physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the D@@ RK @-@ readiness R@@ abl@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the land@@ lords , both intern@@ s , would like to settle down as house doctors . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a consultation room .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers will receive a total of 50,000 euros in the framework of a funding program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; says S &amp; D Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the north @-@ German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dental practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor existed , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours are still watching the familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the cliffs . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; a little bit of melanch@@ oly , they already feel after the long time . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often &quot; , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband supplements him : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed for gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; said interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can &quot; of course &quot; do so . &quot;
the focus is on the supply and security of the people .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia p@@ onder@@ s &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - denied Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also build corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see it in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ oren is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ es will not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country will be reck@@ oned with about 4,000 refugees , &quot; said interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade regre@@ t@@ ted that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the 500 kilometres distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually lead to a previous postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call the details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s media reports they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not currently deal with very high numbers of refugees .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advice migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous , however : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mines . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of getting insight into even un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketing and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says SE@@ C . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the USA and from Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
a lively operation prev@@ ails around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people take care of their worries , partly fast step@@ pers , partly comfortably glo@@ om@@ ily . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the parade square .
keep track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunshine and middle of it four big pla@@ ques each with the heading &quot; Bev@@ or I die I want .... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid drew attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
&quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and read the sentence &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; read the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world will come to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work , which is supported by the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action was good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that everyone does not want to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , is understandable , and finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years contributed much to the opening of people . &quot;
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ying shares .
the funeral and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteer workers of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid sought Hon@@ orary Arti@@ fici@@ ally , she immediately announced herself and was present at the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ ying belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ying works well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of families and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and funeral services .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the Catholic Church House ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; there , too , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in the next May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 and , despite higher envel@@ opes for bo@@ d@@ transports of heavy and large pack@@ ets , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless anticipated that the result will increase over the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces solid earnings when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of Riv@@ alen U@@ PS who plans to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned € 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which were predic@@ ting twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts predicted 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
&quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to the St@@ ag@@ Vetropack Group . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales in bo@@ d@@ house transport rose by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to take the lead for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ oming over them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey sitting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive through the short @-@ term interest rate that is near zero since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - even by a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what is unsure of itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interro@@ gated by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that a further increase is far from . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration in order to calm the financial markets so that she would not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good path to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition would expect . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world coinci@@ ded with the end of the month after China de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Price fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cause global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , and the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; pain@@ stak@@ ing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , campaig@@ ning for a raise raise , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives have revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a raise raise because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping basket makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is located near the till@@ s and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat bar is extensive , as well as the fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you . &quot;

&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide courses are suitable for trol@@ leys and for@@ klift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown , a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with their 74 licenses , she still likes to teach . &quot;
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding nutrition
the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organization SP@@ RS is trying to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are su@@ cking up breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried granted the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
&quot; planning for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ ast building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports area is coming step by step : during the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to this , the committee had , among other things , approved an application for an &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special shape regarding the roof structure .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is : &quot; we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; deliver@@ ance , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energy reasons - was supposed to be less than in the construction plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning plan for roof inclin@@ ation allows no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally leaves more restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; but this is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense of costs .
supplements are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Office of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s hospital , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees would be employed at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining inside station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer will cooperate with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the Federal C@@ rank , will be used as shelter for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there were several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positively and very comprehen@@ sively &quot; received by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are called tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the bath@@ ers had a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were employed , as the police reported . &quot;
after a shot an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was unclear at first . &quot;
the crime police have been determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who had been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old man from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also recorded on Tuesday evening , is considered to be an active participant who , according to the fact , was admitted and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after having come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially thrust at the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the event of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the arrest , the authorities reported in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was placed in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a sla@@ p on him . &quot;
information about the near @-@ term circumstances is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment mosquito
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ cils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study is carried out on behalf of the association &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; in this way 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany shoots a deficit in housing that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently around 77@@ 0.000 housing units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people were living in large cities not@@ ched into shared flat rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has been declining for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to stimulate social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the basic tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be limited . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tization opportunities are required according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee housing of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well underway in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million Euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia lead Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no transit anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik border , reported the Croatian television broad@@ caster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both with the bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a border fence . &quot;
the border stri@@ pe bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance must now quickly create a safe passage . &quot;
&quot; after Hungary , however , hardly more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 arrested people . &quot;
shortly before the closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy and damage the border z@@ a@@ us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; , &quot; almost all - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
&quot; only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left in the last weeks on the road@@ side .
scrap skel@@ et@@ ons were disman@@ tled and one of the host camps was rebuilt in the border town .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees arrive after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot . &quot;
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; over the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had caught un@@ expect@@ edly on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein concludes , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ ased the borders with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before that , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drink . &quot;
&quot; we said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched on Sunday evening in W@@ els from an ICE into a regional train towards Passa@@ u , in order to try the railway traffic to Germany after the short notice , but still to try to cross the border . &quot;
but the regional train was stopped at the river Inn close to the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , day before a two @-@ bridge run spor@@ adi@@ cally - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the dun@@ n@@ age of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; yellow land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge facing the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , with us to produce decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 har@@ dy lod@@ gings &quot;
Konrad got all hands full with refugee support .
Christian Konrad used to say that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to place lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in the first Tak@@ eover Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad is expecting a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial governor .
they had promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born tomorrow , with a clear clari@@ fication of how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator will also have great expectations in the ORF @-@ Aktion &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for placing them as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , there can be no need for quarters to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be valid . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the Ministry of the Interior , he succ@@ eeds Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their head@@ count to three to four .
his own search for districts was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the people affected can currently be accommodated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , other locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the city chief is critic@@ ised for the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
&quot; other districts , too , have to make their contribution . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ des further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria now also carries out controls on its borders is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is now officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also acquired which to acquire . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - wher@@ eu@@ pon Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is dis@@ regarded by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cades : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a store , &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la @-@ Produc@@ ers , who are at home in Bologna , were delighted with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big area Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is recycled .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place named An@@ ders .
&quot; this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the U.S. president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for setting off .
&quot; whether it speaks to foreign hos@@ tility , re@@ porters or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term many in the wine village on the wine route .
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village are about -@@ ump@@ teen corners related to him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , among which besides Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to say in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to believe that Tru@@ mp is &quot; a big mouth &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the initi@@ ator , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated , and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once dismissed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film release . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinct statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ ed , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; he is always so dis@@ ap@@ pointing . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family ended with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which has been inter@@ viewed for long for the Tru@@ mp , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ cks , even in the USA the interest is a@@ wo@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ resident @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today Today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are OK , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6.000 visitors . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ seed ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was en@@ gros@@ sed in sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical manner why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was to receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a game @-@ killer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes her and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit to the house made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously wasn &apos;t just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood would choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his desperate catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian fans had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high refugee figures .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wand , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ red@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will be recru@@ ited in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free elec@@ torate of the Free Elec@@ toral Plan conven@@ es in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commune until Friday .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the former Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ tor boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ red@@ ger also asked more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ red@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed nationwide uniform standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves off , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more action @-@ capable . &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
many years of permanent bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um middle stage will be tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do that .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere , wherever desired . &quot;
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits over long stretches and nervous trade history .
&quot; only in the afternoon a fir@@ mer start of the US exchanges caused a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
&quot; the medium @-@ sized M@@ DA@@ X won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ D@@ ax increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the lead index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked exchanges in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index reported last year around 1 percent in sales . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; many analysts expect the markets to take place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the large decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot;
the debate about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the RW@@ E stocks to a record low and left deep marks even in E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a retailer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors currently too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA gave a share on the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
automobil@@ es Daimler and BMW contributed by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen power increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on investment of listed federal securities was reduced to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the course of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost € 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu city . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain stipul@@ ations in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
building area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square metres of land in direct proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; you wait for corresponding offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
which investor come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner Big street , just a few months ago and the building on it had been demol@@ ished . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; for months behind closed doors was negotiated , bur@@ dened , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday village near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , who submitted sec@@ rec@@ y to the investor and the administration , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends retired from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , this project has been in discussion for some ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
strong reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a huge log that overlooks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; whole bus loads must come to make this worthwhile , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening in the area of the former restaurant , which is just over a hect@@ are , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first of all , we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ stepped the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the fund@@ raising call on its blog .
&quot; instead of making an announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately look for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / 100 will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many refugees also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years obesity operations have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight relative to size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the new study used the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ch@@ ur@@ king - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and 28 % were partially affected . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was reduced entirely by just one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , reflecting blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and earlier recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent adi@@ pos@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their body to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is becoming increasingly observ@@ able in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the U.S. report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swallow strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 who report le@@ thal control centers climbed from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how youngsters are drinking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be tempted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the station Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ i@@ ding dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to the hospital in a emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words , and was unable to go as she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active substance . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her out of her room .
the police considered the scor@@ ched plan as a &quot; gun &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities .

&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control since they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic Olympics and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it just like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer windows . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was higher than that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I become a witness to an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ep@@ ad and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after a damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded him to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ came the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , this one tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me &apos; , said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspir@@ ational native people to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria , claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g trial in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I &apos;d like to walk around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb explo@@ de in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his st@@ ables .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses as they have failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the conclusion that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people out of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ et@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly put mud on the leg .
it would have been like last night .
&quot; it would have been the same yesterday , what was the case . &quot;
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one goes too far , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot;
man arrested for pad@@ do@@ cks
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be indic@@ ted for drivers &quot; flight and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy cri@@ p@@ pled criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ setting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm @-@ Player &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly concealed remark to the Storm Team after his team finished the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample &quot; &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team beat him confi@@ dently , as it means that they were worried that they were beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this time and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring battles as they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques all over the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock to him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this always comes up at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drugs charges &quot;
&quot; a man who potentially threatened a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to acquire 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested in the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and deposited in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the solic@@ itor of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he with@@ drew his Australian and Serbian passport , reported to the police daily and was locked at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left to the left in the last moment , as the police told . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing agent tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it and found the bewil@@ dering messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches used to search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lia on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but he said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and plac@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June of last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg not to appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was given a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases pending . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of the judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
&quot; for fear of discovery and arrest , many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers were increasingly attracted to smaller border cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and traffic .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen and forwarded for registration .
&quot; in the Munich Central Station , more refugees once again met in accordance with the Federal Police Reg@@ ulations on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8@@ am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm turbines in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German meteor@@ ological service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even to Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be reck@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun is to be seen again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : roughly 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August , this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in the view , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the International Motor Show . &quot;
and what will be followed next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and high@@ lighting sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; it comes to trade at the beginning of next year , and then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dealer wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ d put their hands on the front side : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , above all , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison facility Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot in accordance with his lawyer &apos;s statements , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant failed because of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the judges rejected the decision of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for the re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation .
&quot; even if for legal reasons , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention are decisive for the compensation , be a compensation claim , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clear the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they first spoke in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2011 decision , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months , between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell , as in the case of the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also gone into the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to m@@ allets it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ pt , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed for lack of offspring , 19 are to be cancelled in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , about 800 000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated resolve in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space , however , is dramatic above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units would have to be created every year , and for this the federal government would have to invest USD 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there was a political change according to the throne of Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to pay asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view was mostly enforced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; up to now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is the royal road to the integration of labour . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ stools , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of the German will be prepared in classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception so far has been Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees have had to live four years in Germany to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span will be reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get b@@ af@@ o@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually place the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of an Islamic &quot; &quot; welfare organization &quot; &quot; would also be important to take care of the new arri@@ vals professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; to this end , there is also the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to su@@ ck such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination and gender equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ ran@@ ational organisations and the interested groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and which international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says the medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers right away from the registration of health cards . &quot;
provided services could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly dou@@ bt@@ ful that so many people have to travel with the limited range of services that the asylum application law provides . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors usually do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting more informed about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
many refugees have also helped many refugees with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
&quot; in refugee camps , for example , there are clearly more untreated han@@ di@@ caps , and in young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors come from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and concerning the don@@ ka , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is being traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called pul@@ ley backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms being chronic , an early treatment was necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not educated for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the arena invites you to dream on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of managers . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift for enthusiasts lies in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to get rid of people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; a cocktail cocktail with world @-@ city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family spell the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to take up the Cuban duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer female hearts in a storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the Ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and arti@@ stry . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the fl@@ y@@ wheel ?
for He Yu@@ an is not a problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well for us either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each car@@ ving unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes as possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the top commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are doing our best . &quot;
&quot; from September 17 to 20 , the Pro@@ bst will invite you to see your performances daily at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe has given wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest leader in Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls .
last month they had booked it and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year HP will share in two listed companies , and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and in @-@ depth portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930 &apos;s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb beyond the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed the fact that it was only September and where his rehabilitation went to plan , there was no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of arsen@@ als 157 league games during the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 which have seen most vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has pulled the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco , and remains driven by the hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the goal of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication controlled by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focusing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer shots in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telep@@ hon@@ y I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suscep@@ tible to suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider state over the phone can help people in moments of despair , too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend , Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris takes a strong start to the Swedish master , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ storm was named as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he completed Johan Wil@@ and beautifully in the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps Post posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was spar@@ ed by no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second goal finally dropped shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c refresh@@ ed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent range of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi found a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , located in Switzerland , which is affected by a collap@@ sing commodity price , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday through a sale of stock as part of its huge school student plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ , in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn is pushing demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issu@@ ance of subscription rights delivered a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to destroy about a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; President Obama &apos;s visit will offer an opportunity to extend American Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construct areas of dis@@ agreements in a constructive way , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before travelling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi could address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying on China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;
440 @-@ hp sports car borrow@@ ed and driven to scrap

&quot; on the wet highway , the evil awakening occurred . &quot;
&quot; at a company in Got@@ ha district , one can fulfil the dream and once again bor@@ row a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 hp . &quot;
so did this also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the Got@@ ha district .
on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream was then gone and passed .
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the spin on wet road and drove to the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , nobody was injured . &quot;
&quot; the damage will be estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champi@@ ons league winner , two times club champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he stood before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; at that time , Madrid won all , we have nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the determining man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that , he has got me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time in 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , split the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the royal triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown burst when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not by filling the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments from The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ ire , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to the movie ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ W@@ ING it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color @-@ abi@@ ding . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quietly matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums always have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful prize and changes life , it receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he got any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father of a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the s@@ ling@@ ton well , &quot; &quot; said A@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks hit a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall completed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game by an un@@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game to make a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right side , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers posted a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he is not very well beaten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder reduction , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is stri@@ cken from the injury list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing from the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who were born there should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital were prepared in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily sub@@ side .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen , according to the government president responsible for the first survey . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; collective way@@ points . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; now the conflict is landing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls the south and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Interior Minister , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ caster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is agreed &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there had already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees from Hungary came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee agreement in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four years of deliber@@ ations with the prime minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ scored those people who needed protection , too . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion was unanim@@ ously dealt with in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 km border with Serbia in the night to Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania closed with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us flo@@ ats a global ocean .
&quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spatial probe &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this movement is small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; specialist sheet . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , it was known that there must be liquid water beneath the ice blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , closed the astronom@@ ers at that time . &quot;
&quot; the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München for several weeks
the 1860 München must abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an examination revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; probably means four weeks of forced break &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive man as a training guest . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game near Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at his head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious dres@@ sage . &quot;
no fruit diet - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar , especially sac@@ char@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Also , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
when buying man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to hearty dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS brings up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS raised its workforce of 9@@ 5,000 aid to its workforce for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first fl@@ ing tower , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the mountains of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland broad@@ cast@@ ed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ead @-@ valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjoining center , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alpine footh@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; here rain sets , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , South of the Alps must be reck@@ oned with some over 100 liters of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours , this after large rainf@@ all has already fallen over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow dri@@ es out the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my , and temperatures are going down considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days in the north present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) took a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time as a deca@@ ying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent church with his thes@@ es against the trade of aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ markt is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with sump@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics like crosses , pla@@ gues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Sovereign Order of Malta . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing took place with the cane reed , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work on it , in order to be able to bear me again with the Lord . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to restore art in a quick@@ long time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; &quot; into the pictures , let them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; &quot; the picture seeks his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday for the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also chosen the most important , mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
&quot; plans made , place , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ one , especially in the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill deported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go in October , the first joint municipality of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;

&quot; I believe this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t bother me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to interest everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must set the policy .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach explained at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can be , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , director of sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama rises every day , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ alists , no , we have to use our bril@@ liance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European qualification match against Hungary . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board loses an eye in accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen after midnight on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then pushed out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; however , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we met at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it &apos;s important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

&quot; as a result , at the weekend in Singapore , he is just as little as reserve main@@ tainer for the two stam@@ pe@@ ers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ tables in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have definitely broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach revealed : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem from the R@@ eus position . &quot;
he then announced a change to the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the family @-@ keepers Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether turn@@ tables will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel was open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ en@@ sic evidence of Mit@@ spiel@@ R@@ eus , that the final one for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl comprehensible , &quot; &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to lead the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communications . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test line on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government intends to examine the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around the world to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car takes over the lead increasingly , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , &quot; &quot; dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads &quot; &quot; are to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the supervisory authority Dek@@ ra , results in only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will succeed in the next ten years , while 32 percent do not count on it until 20 years . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not prepared to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good any fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under control .
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; based on the current status of the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf , Düsseldorf , wants to open only in single . &quot;
the final decision will be due at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to reti@@ re on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded us of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the World R@@ ole Fi@@ fth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s true , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18 , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he was , in fact , on the other hand , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one enters the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written history without ever completing his training .
&quot; the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort has been carried out : in order to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have brought 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special feature : a leather trousers outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the dis@@ mis@@ sal of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , but of course . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to be meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example for blankets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a greater role and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ industrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stal@@ ks , is an increasing customer potential . &quot;
anyone who does not serve niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
mo@@ ck@@ le P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot;
there are almost no longer private specialist shops and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass production is made much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the weak@@ est export is currently being exported to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , high @-@ quality and innovative products have to be found . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the history of snow .
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small cu@@ ffs in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from this : &quot; &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ um top - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of continuation , which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wide out@@ wards to foster growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned by the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the manag@@ erial group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizen alarm system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved through test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investments will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part , as reported in a statement released following the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fishing
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to gain a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding EU job document , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and adverse events of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks and s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; are lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in return for this sl@@ ack@@ ening , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low @-@ charged , that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that only helps the economy , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans . it is strongly enriched over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system , especially in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury gets into the environment mainly due to coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants come across more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , has been &quot; permanently and across the surface , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
