&quot; a ) To ensure effective implementation of the security measures according to this Convention , the Community of the Organization shall inform the Community of the Organization in accordance with this Convention Information on Nu@@ clear Materials , which is subject to safegu@@ arding measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment involved in carrying out the securing measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on assets is limited to the minimum required for the use of security measures relating to the core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the Community , the organisation is prepared to check the investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally obsol@@ ete , provided that they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation brings the consent of the Community and States to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Provi@@ des the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a given designation , the organisation of the Community and the states proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; ( III ) If due to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are ham@@ pered by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal to take appropriate measures with the aim of meeting the General Director of the Organization . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their Convention , can actually experience them . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
( II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials carrying out tasks in accordance with this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement are concluded in relation to core material , if the community and the organization find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to the agreement , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of core material from the states that are subject to the security measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the recipient &apos;s state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , takes responsibility for the safegu@@ arding measures after this agreement , as soon as the recipient &apos;s state has taken responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the association with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances , the securing measures in accordance with this agreement shall be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the core material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the period of non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community agree on a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be re@@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held by the total quantity and the composition of this material in the state or the state concerned , and any transfer of such material from this state or these states to the current one . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or a knowledge of military action under sec@@ rec@@ y and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow from this agreement in carrying out their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their jurisdiction , however extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has already clari@@ fied in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used according to their laws and other regulations , to the organization and their officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same manner as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
any claim that the Community or a State against the Organization or the Organisation against the Community or the State due to damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - is asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the fac@@ tual information presented by the General Director , the Council shall ensure that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the measures taken by the measures employed by the measures applied and offer the community or the state - as far as each of the parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or state , consultations are held on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the State concerned to participate in discussing such issues by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes relating to an assessment of the Council by Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ration tribunal on request of a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed appoint a fifth who presi@@ des over the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the states or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable , if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ core states , the contracting party of the contract and are members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this agreement and &quot;
&quot; II ) If the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the objective of the safegu@@ arding measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the degradation of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a degradation by the risk of premature detection .
&quot; for the exhaus@@ tion of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the examination by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material not shown for a particular period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their checks , the organization makes full use of the security system of the community after article 3 full use . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of the core material and the quantity of stock ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which points out the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes of this stock including the input and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) Intro@@ duc@@ ing ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet reached the states , the organisation of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced to the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to preventive measures in accordance with this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire amount of material delivered in the states is not at any time more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ all@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with an accumulation , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liberated core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the security measures following this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization supplementary agreements that are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective fusion of the tasks of the Organization pursuant to this Convention , in the individual as to how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all the efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the engagement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation publishes a compiled inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their follow @-@ up examinations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by common res@@ sources problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible , is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which the Member States will contribute to the special transaction . this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the transaction account is separate and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ paid notes of the member state , which are paid upon request in the currency of the State in order of the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker of the transaction account and to be deposited at the office of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may be able to make payments prior to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportion@@ ate drawing to the cash or the tuition fees to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) Com@@ position and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered for the purposes of the organization funded by the organization , with the objective of the affir@@ m@@ ity referred to in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able at ten free @-@ years each in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
payments to pay this watch are directly connected to the organization that retains them .
&quot; each special transaction loan is to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is specified in particular . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who , according to the extent of the loan granted , may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until full disclosure of all transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation . &quot;
&quot; during the period of re@@ payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the bai@@ li@@ ff transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this Statement of Statement . &quot;
&quot; after full pa@@ yout of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are based on the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special action plans and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat manages these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the stated notice in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is made in two copies in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T en@@ acted as follows : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation are transferred to a Common Company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research work that has reached a higher priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. the joint aim of these research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or modified by articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , this will take place at the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association is realised in paragraph 1 by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories dealing with the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of each program .
&quot; as part of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association signed in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; as far as possible , with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement to the Joint Venture of J@@ ET , whose by@@ laws are accepted . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose aim falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement , the organs associated with the implementation of the Association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 of the present agreement are described . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement is intended to include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
to monitor the development of research work and to steer clear that best results are achieved in accordance with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to guarantee the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated organs and focuses on its T * ity in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common objective stated in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss Programme , as well as to the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG design@@ ates one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which allows the VG research proposals to provide the best possible scientific results for the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task in respect of all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors who monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , are optimally fu@@ elled with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide the directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , staff and knowledge and skills that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F belongs to the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission regarding the implementation of the programme and the changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programmes and the definition of their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Executive Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG to the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
representatives of the two parties involved work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme according to this agreement is fixed annually to an amount that is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same ratio as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year .
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Fir@@ m as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects J@@ ET to the Joint Venture of J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the provisions of the Statute of this Joint Venture . &quot;
&quot; the contribution of the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel sharing is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover costs within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year in question . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the remaining payment arrangements for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are stipul@@ ated in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom of duties or other taxes , as well as import restrictions and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the items funded by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in this country , goods acquired or acquired in Switzerland must neither be disposed of nor free of charge , unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves the conditions that the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to rest @-@ he@@ aters and lad@@ ders who are paid to these people .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge specified in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge applicable to Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Joint Venture of J@@ ET , are governed in Article 14 of this agreement and in the Articles of Association of the Common Company . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could include a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks put an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all the member states &apos;s future delivery fund . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; in every stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans as well as in their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first drawing would not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the means of the bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the required resources on the market itself , then the interest rate used for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Libor acc@@ ru@@ ed by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
the BI@@ S could include a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks put an appropriate application .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force - I
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
&quot; 2 . acknowledge that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this Convention , fores@@ een for developing countries , may be insufficient for five years in accordance with Article 21 ( 1 ) in practice for some developing countries . &quot;

&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on Trade , H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot;
&quot; I honor to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat , as follows : in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in slaugh@@ ter@@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the quantity agreed in the year exceeds the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the form of supply be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community uses the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access of Argentina regulated in this agreement is not affected by the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a height of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when new member states are admitted , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount stated under number 2 is set on the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaugh@@ ter@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community strikes provisions in order for the sales of ven@@ ison to frozen meat not to under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that , within the quantities specified in this agreement , export licenses are issued for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its part , the Community ple@@ dges to make all necessary arrangements to ensure the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products , originating in Argentina by the template of an export license , issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the distribution of the import license for the products to be processed can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , in implementing provisions , the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall notify the responsible authority of the Community in regular intervals the amounts given for the export lic@@ ences ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and will operate smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions stated in number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not called collective numbers after the Community . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss any issues arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that sheep farming and export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement for amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the quantity specified in the year does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the prescribed quantities are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the Community affir@@ ms that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community market .
&quot; should a change of the supply form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community uses the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a height of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities specified in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trading with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the stated clause of the value added in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community , to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions so that the paragraph of ven@@ ison items on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of this goal . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties do everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without risk for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand warran@@ ts adher@@ ence to the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; in its part , the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions to ensure the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products originating in New Zealand from the template of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the distribution of the import license for the products to be processed can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; it is also specified that in regular intervals , the competent New Zealand authority shall notify the responsible authorities of the community at regular intervals , for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and will operate smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of the agreement is not affected by the fact that articles from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all issues arising in the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement are subject to prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the amount specified in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year , the amount is determined in relation to the total amount of the year . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand as well as for New Zealand &apos;s main area on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement comes into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to cancel it with a deadline of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be checked by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary . &quot;
I invite you to propose that this letter and your reply together form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .

human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is the blood of a healthy man and blood ming@@ led with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a closed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ance solution has been gro@@ oved prior to steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; once the blood is removed , the bottle can be closed immediately and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it must be re@@ opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ ine solution may not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not fall below 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system has previously been determined by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as it is standardized or recommended for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have shown the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged after this Convention shall only be used for recipient of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is stored in sterile , closed bottle from micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the periods required for testing and transport , which may be at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood begins to cool down to 4 to 6 C immediately . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the fluid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so it is also possible to specify its volume and composition on the label . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through drying out of the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ ge or sedi@@ mentation of human whole blood . &quot;
the human dry plasma is obtained through cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the quantity of liquid that is used in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution thus obtained may not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh serum sample ) a dangerous content of hem@@ oly@@ sin or immune hem@@ or@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been established are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after blood removal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;

&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents , indicated on the label , depends on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities . &quot;
&quot; dried re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ser@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to lead to the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or re@@ dissolved serum .

&quot; the quantity in a container must be so large , that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all returned re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their active part in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin . &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react according to the possibility of blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen@@ ic C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with in@@ und@@ ations of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these Ser@@ a are only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are sw@@ amped in a 0.@@ 99 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 against c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals who are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ ined antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is , in parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ able , separated with in@@ und@@ ations of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells to Tit@@ le ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 percent flood of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any in@@ und@@ ulation within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , in parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ amount , with an in@@ und@@ ation of blood cells of the group B to Tit@@ le ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flood of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ecting human serum proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any in@@ anim@@ ate human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; the Parties to the European Convention on 14 May 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; ) - &quot;
&quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention that &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures , &quot; to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances provided by other parties of human origin from all input levels ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion to the jurisdiction of the Community falls , which according to the Treaty by which it was founded , has the required powers ; &quot;
&quot; from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the Member States of the Council of Europe , all the States and the European Economic Community appro@@ ving every assumption or objection in the sense of Article 2 , as well as the time of entry into force of this additional protocol pursuant to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA Coun@@ tries and Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the border form@@ alities and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; on 1 January 1988 , within the Action Programme to strengthen the internal market , the Community has decided to introduce a unified management paper on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a single management document , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that this agreement must not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the parties from their obligations arising from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set in order to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single passport ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method used in goods transport ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; con@@ form@@ ities related to goods transport between the parties of the contract shall be gro@@ unded by a single api@@ xel , for which preliminary prints are to be used according to the pattern in Anne@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the single @-@ sheet paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out legal provisions in force in force of a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the single document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be asked by the participants , so that they can come upon request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , in view of further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods in question are not placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must be submitted subsequently , with the consent of the relevant authorities for a peri@@ odic collection registration , within the deadline stated by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use instead of a single api@@ xel commercial paper . &quot;
&quot; if a single paper is used , the parties involved in the import and import@@ ation proceedings may add common lists to the import paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the obligations for their entire goods transport , or for sub @-@ sectors ; &quot;
&quot; - in the case of consi@@ gn@@ ments which include several types of goods , to facilitate the transfer of sal@@ aries in the shipping method , instead of the supplementary sheets on a single @-@ sheet paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow regi@@ strations to be created , if necessary , by public or private data processing systems according to the conditions specified by the relevant authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - grant that the relevant authorities require the input of the required data in their data processing systems for the treatment of registration , and may , if necessary , without giving a written notification ; &quot;
&quot; - grant that the competent authorities in the event of using a data processing system for the treatment of applications fores@@ ee that the export , shipping or import registration is either generated by the single @-@ sheet paper or , if such a paper is not created , by entering data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
- to apply facil@@ itation passed by the Joint Committee in the way of a resolution in accordance with Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the provisions required for export , shipping and import of goods are stipul@@ ated in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre @-@ printed in the App@@ endi@@ x I , are to be taken from Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the provisions for export or shipping shall be gro@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or the transit country of the applicant or its representative in this country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Un@@ contrary to paragraph 1 , registration shall always be entered into one of the official languages of the import country , if it is carried out in this country by use of other than the copy of the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration copies of the contract parties for each individual procedure section of the contract , to which , if necessary , the necessary copies may be included in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the particular provisions on collective shipments , the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the for@@ warding and shipping procedures are based on the same pre@@ form by means of the copies intended for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings shall be consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth return of goods between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries impose one another on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be completely or partially denied or rejected if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or to viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In ref@@ using or rej@@ ecting the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification is in@@ compatible with the country being sought after . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which she could not afford , if she was asked , she points to this circum@@ stance in her request . &quot;
( 5 ) The provisions received in paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection granted by the national law of the country that it has received .
&quot; these information may only be used with the written consent of the customs authority , which it has issued and shall be otherwise used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by the authority . &quot;
( 1 ) A mixed Committee shall be used in which any contracting party is represented in this convention .
&quot; ( 4 ) The Joint Committee shall be governed by a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which regul@@ ates the con@@ vocation of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub@@ committees and work@@ groups to support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task of managing this Convention and ensuring its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the Committee shall regularly inform the parties about practical experience with the application of the Convention ; it speaks recommendations and , in cases of paragraph 3 , takes decisions . &quot;
( 3 ) The Joint Committee resol@@ ves amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention as well as the Er@@ l@@ ations mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepts a resolution under the provis@@ o of the provision of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that no date is called , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets suitable measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , whereby the need to be taken into account is to reduce the loading of the goods traffic to the extent possible and to provide satisfactory solutions to the problems arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand as well as for the areas of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention applies also to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein , as long as the Princip@@ ality is connected with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union contract . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement under a twelve @-@ month deadline ; the written notice shall be addressed to the custo@@ os@@ it@@ ar mentioned in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies them of all other parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the parties have deposited their acceptance certificates with the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , the first day of the second month will come into effect on the first day of the second month . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish . it is submitted in the Archives of the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
I allow me to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will meet this wish as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . faced with the Commission &apos;s responsibility in matters relating to the management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to evaluate the stock situation and the reports of its Advisory Committee on Fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how the cooperation between the two parties will intensi@@ fy , and in particular examine the possibilities provided by the Commission to establish a closer link to the Council &apos;s Advisory Committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . at the signing of this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 D@@ KR and make annual payments . &quot;
the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings which are conven@@ ed upon special request by the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be renewed on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
any party at any time has the possibility to res@@ ign from the agreement under a one @-@ year notice period .
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agreed to recognise the observer status as observer status in meetings of the Advisory Committee on the Council &apos;s fish@@ eries management committee . &quot;

&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce costs resulting from the fact that goods must be re @-@ submitted and re @-@ enco@@ ded during the transition from a classification system to another , to facilitate the unification of the trade documents and the transmission of data , &quot;
&quot; in the assignment that the development of technology and structures of international trade requires significant changes in the Brussels Agreement dated 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE decree that the measure of differentiation required by the governments and the economy for customs tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is included in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for cargo tari@@ ffs and traffic statistics of different transport types , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that the harmon@@ ized system is intended to be included in the systems used in the trade for the designation and coding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in DER hei@@ v@@ ature , the harmon@@ ized system should contribute to a close inter@@ relation between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , in the weighing system , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the International War@@ p Directory should be maintained for foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that it is desirable to comply with the above requirements by a combined tari@@ ff and statistics cl@@ ature , which is suitable for use by the international trade involved , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing , that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Committee for the cooperation in the field of customs services , for the harmon@@ ized system in this field , &quot;
&quot; - although the aforementioned agreement on the tari@@ ff scheme has proven to be an effective instrument in order to achieve some of these goals , the conclusion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this agreement means a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the designation and coding of the goods , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ized system , &quot; consisting of positions and sub@@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to sections . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ; &quot;
