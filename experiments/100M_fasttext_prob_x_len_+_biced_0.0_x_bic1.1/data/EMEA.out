this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have approached the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are removed as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , that is , chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears primarily as a &quot; partial agent &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies by up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; even more effective than placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , sensation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus the risks .
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changes of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy have signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study for 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , was compared with patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapies , and about their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is of benefit , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma rating . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is convey@@ ed by the combination of a partial diag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ es and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ file . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients were employed in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was an increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ isation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients did not show any gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a non @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al cor@@ tex and combined adren@@ al cor@@ tex ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( ranging from 1 to 3 times the middle steam state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is convey@@ ed by the combination of a partial diag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melt tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases after the start or after changes of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is convey@@ ed by the combination of a partial diag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was an increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Out@@ comes a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the medium @-@ steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ gra@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in people with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with some episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the resor@@ ption and to minimize vari@@ ability , injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the symptoms of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were caused differently by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ de , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isation , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers can result in joint use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole administration . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapies , and about their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ gi@@ cation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ cation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ ic reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ tis , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients were employed in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was an increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than AU@@ C after the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to both form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns occurred after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , about three quarters of which used to receive anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in single dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival .
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment must be interrupted until improvement is reached in grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ methods and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child to witness . &quot;
&quot; prior to treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm count , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .
&quot; the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects , which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported at 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , elevated lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscular sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ timi@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the combination of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ ac@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in the tumor area due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non @-@ registered trials and 4@@ 54 patients , who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III trial study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 Results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a grade for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy as a result of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or weight binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine loss was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorization will provide the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials before the market launch :
&quot; • Educational brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging samples . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ation boxes for transport by patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels that may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if an own blood donation is not possible prior to surgery and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases that the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment , in order to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ tis deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference dentist , when inj@@ ected into a vein as part of a trial with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were kept in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients ) .
&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this will not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg a permit for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical interventions that require a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to an adult without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired goal is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the optic disc number ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the bas@@ eline , the dose should be retained by 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the optic disc number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared with the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the optic disc number increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , should the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the optic disc number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the bas@@ eline , is an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - before starting the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy large iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each of 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic boiling sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic , ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not eligible for a major orthop@@ a@@ edic operation and who do not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently experienced cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA to mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ a toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the optic nerve is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason for a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity data in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the administration of epo@@ et@@ ine when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should assess a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that may need to be trans@@ fi@@ gured ) . &quot;
if the increase in H@@ b is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ otherap@@ ist an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; if possible , prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should obtain appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ Treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations . &quot;
the genetic epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ glob@@ s ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mo@@ carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis . &quot;
survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and with controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa prescri@@ p@@ tions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved following intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 . in animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for clinical situations . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of up to 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are marked with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ing label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be taken under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the owner of the marketing authorization must supply the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in Version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is established before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as it is used in the traffic . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the licensing agreement comm@@ its itself to the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) described in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) described in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan . &quot;
&quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information that may affect the current safety specifications , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • In a month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ump formation in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred . &quot;
&quot; severe circulation disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the carot@@ id arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ic after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore ab@@ se@@ amed by injection must be given into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of blood ar@@ thro@@ sis with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly in order to keep the risk of a blood drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you have a major orthop@@ edic surgery , ab@@ se@@ amed should be examined and treated accordingly before treatment begins with ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood drop formation after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will , if necessary , arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia affects the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vas@@ odi@@ lation ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment . &quot;

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones become br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a minor frac@@ ture of hip frac@@ tures such as the disease ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms that occur in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of frac@@ tures and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized , or at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients who discuss the side effects of the medicine and indicate when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to approve Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ conveni@@ ences throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When resor@@ ted to medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s application .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data for safety and efficacy are missing . &quot;
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s application ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the changes in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured each year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ cor@@ ps in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on the avoid@@ ance of frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on the avoid@@ ance of frac@@ tures after a recently recovered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area has been developed , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery .
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with a patient treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the event of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for s@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric blood cell frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % lower risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge were taken . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the retention of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ cor@@ sta compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline , and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all time points .
&quot; compared to placebo treatment , Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total , and 4.3 % on the threshold . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in patients compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not subject to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moderate @-@ wei@@ ghted Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two months of comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief compared with the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate was observed after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with acet@@ amin@@ at , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma level rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ h 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a prolonged period of elimination with a terminal exclusion period t ½ γ 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ aci@@ al concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of metabol@@ ised substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid is not metabol@@ ised in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ changing inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid cor@@ related with Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , and in the 64 examined patients mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for trials in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose related to the 7@@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were performed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity at doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is delivered as a package with a bottle as a packing unit or as a bund@@ ling package consisting of 5 packs , each containing a bottle . &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When resor@@ ted to medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the Pharmac@@ co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk management plan The owner of the licensing agreement comm@@ its the trials and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all of the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is disclosed , which could influence the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ cor@@ po works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , providing a normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when Ac@@ cor@@ sta is used together with food and drinks , you are concerned that in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new date .
&quot; before stopping the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls , consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms in yourself after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or cre@@ eping or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around your mouth . &quot;
&quot; nausea , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , ting@@ ling / stit@@ ching , drow@@ sin@@ ess , pain , pain in the eyes , headache , headache , heart redness , pain , swelling , skin rash , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is also used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or more ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) .
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking compared to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tissue . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is required while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied , unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; even in patients who - besides obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close @-@ to @-@ date persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek emergency medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort ) is not studied , it is assumed that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; patients with overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity have been examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in additional indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who have been treated for weight loss and related metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects , the following frequency are basically laid : &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a comparative study , in which a limited number of individuals were given dispos@@ able donations of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia at the same time .
&quot; for weight reduction after one year , A@@ comp@@ lia amounted to 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo was 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Wei@@ ght reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average drop in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours reached , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food influence : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the brood @-@ state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed a 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x resp@@ . 48 % increased ng AU@@ C in the case of the food supply . &quot;
patients with black skin color can hold up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n @-@ Popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse events , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic range , were considered to be potentially relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress appears to be associated with the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adjusted sufficiently with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin and insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was evaluated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo was reduced to 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to authori@@ ze Ac@@ tos inver@@ ting in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated starting liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been exceeded .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can deri@@ ve from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but or@@ derly doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in summary analysis of un@@ desirable events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment must be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ co@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal during pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from available data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to temporary alter@@ ation of the tumour and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents often occurred as often as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch , it was rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study carried out over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fatty and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years in order to study the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive insulin , a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma matri@@ ces and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies showed that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and at a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ cap@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) were induced in the rat .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ es resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study , over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks are associated with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human@@ oid . &quot;
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ one may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ rob@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensive insulin therapy , may change hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ oid or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the push button moves to the outside while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the closing cap directly next to the dosing brand • Note the highest number you can see on the button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the inserted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , rotate the connector cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; if you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , take the following steps : &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transfer of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ously @-@ induced electro@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.@@ 6 % ) .
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total length of the active period amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( ages 13 and 17 ) .

&quot; always set up the closing cap of your Flex@@ Pen , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
F Hold down the fle@@ x@@ Pen with the injection needle and knock a few times with the finger against the cartridge so that existing air bubbles will accumulate in the cartridge .
the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards by turning the dose button in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is against the marking of the dose indicator .
&quot; aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ums ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ o@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent g@@ ush attacks . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ o@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who received aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there is possibly also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one of the cases known or currently present in the case of rheum@@ atism and / or rheum@@ atism ) .
&quot; if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated yet ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other res@@ inous drugs , it is possible to get acute rheum@@ atism during the treatment , because the reduction in serum acid levels can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases so far increase that there is a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight symptoms of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course of clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was not carried out drug interactions at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a inhi@@ bit of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ of@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x measured a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be ruled out on side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful while controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) was observed although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ er @-@ aes@@ th@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short breathing , skin dis@@ color@@ ations , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , increase in potassium concentration in blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te numbers , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effect mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ite in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ tic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ im @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro escap@@ ement , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the percentage of patients in which the last three month serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily versus treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
&quot; in 50@@ 9 patients , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentration in subjects regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the toxic@@ ity size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out node by month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after ing@@ es@@ tion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ eh@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patients of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ dal / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ essly / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In the case of male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , with about 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ Met@@ abolic and Ur@@ ine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; at high doses , which were approximately at 4.3 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied with a reduction in the expenditure and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which were about 4.4 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , did not reveal ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ of@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the percentage of patients in which the last three month serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system as described in Version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available that have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low due to the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and thus achieved with time a reduction of the discomfort . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , or if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated because of a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a poison control at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not necessarily have to be so , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a toxic attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medications , which may include one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may need to consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease ) &quot;
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bone is br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals , approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of boo@@ sting vitamin D levels .
&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also stipul@@ ated that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , broken abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic sur@@ ges . &quot;

&quot; it may not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following guidelines are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al nar@@ rations , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out , in the occurrence of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe sho@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market launch ) , including some serious and with complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens include predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a surgical intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is author@@ itative for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning while failing to take a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures at oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more spinal frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents continued to maintain the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ ating to an intraven@@ ous dose of reference was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after a noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability rose to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily divided into soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the substance selected was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
&quot; following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance does not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems in humans . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the gift of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the course after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate that is not stored in the bone quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the pale yellow cap@@ s@@ ular top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulation ( see below ) .
&quot; after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was comparable to systemic exposure , measured as tal@@ cum , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearance substance , an adaptation of the adv@@ ant dose scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed to take oral medicine in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; in order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; further dose adap@@ tations can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - Switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a gra@@ ft Rec@@ eiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose . &quot;
&quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the or@@ al initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; in the case of adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience in patients with lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts , was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood circulation in the targeted area a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances which may change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the steady state has occurred . &quot;
clinical trials data suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of tal@@ low in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft receivers in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels of blood can be subject to considerable fluctuations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur also under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infection , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the simultaneous dose of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal transit .
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus drugs is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially decrease the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not provide an indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born suggests otherwise harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ cal@@ emia ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus often increase suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) . &quot;
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucleus .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 3@@ 2.6 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; patients &quot; survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm ( 3 women , 5 men ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Basili@@ xi@@ mab antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up@@ - data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs. C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) killed deaths . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , used twice a day , has become a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ t patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had undergone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and used in 6@@ 30 cases after a color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to more than 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplantation , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases in comparison to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who received a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised procedure using tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of tal@@ low from 8 to 15 ng / ml to 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods of early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , leading to Tal@@ ks between 10 and 15 ng / ml , and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed following the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for preventing bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , m@@ aus@@ e- or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis The long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II , per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) The unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror appeared post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory factor ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 days of exposure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was observed in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the active factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ factor for the active factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of the active factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since its initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension proceedings in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw his application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and can cause no infection in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 @-@ gene which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the documents submitted initially , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ec@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the Company has not informed the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; &quot; programmes . &quot;

&quot; in adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ eved on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever syndrome reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergic to hypo@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from con@@ ges@@ tion ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company to authori@@ ze Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to operate throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is generally swal@@ lowed ( i.e. without bit@@ ing it , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued if necessary with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a dimin@@ ished Rhin@@ o antibiotic ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is insufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the following patient groups is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ stering or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not they were taken with alcohol alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing , and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the safety of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregnancy did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness that can lead to impairment of per@@ spir@@ ation or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ e@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the inhibit@@ ory molecule P @-@ Sel@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on the standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the gain of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further lik@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose , and tear or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane which is included in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; diabetes , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer which leads to a nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine , or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the medical history ( breathing difficulties due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases when applying Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart beat , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when using the recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or decreases the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information .
&quot; heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleeping disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely has been reported in cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , cra@@ mps , headache with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of eye @-@ catching liver enzymes have also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and / or . &quot;
&quot; for children between 6 and 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials for seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who had also asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by identifying symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ les , sleeping and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were examined , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients ) . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous course of the disease and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during their recur@@ rence .
&quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , an ongoing treatment can be recommended to patients during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effective effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impairment of per@@ spir@@ ation or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ e@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the inhibit@@ ory molecule P @-@ Sel@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on the standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the gain of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited to chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine replacement is an caus@@ ative factor in all primitive diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of padd@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not work on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ eless , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ eless , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the effective effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor disorders . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced deterioration in performance , nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of padd@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 in various single dose trials showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene inter@@ lock with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once a day , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le should be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the gain of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and removed the dose of the melting tablet without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Si@@ rup@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile found in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the det@@ achment of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the gain of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( adult 2 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical trials for the melt tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not take this medicine with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and , depending on the duration of symptoms , &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution for taking the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose trials , the O@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products in A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a trunk of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus arises , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this common tribe . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral medication the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of having the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generative is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but excluding Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , this drug was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks , but am@@ bush was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , a@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , however , with the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ e@@ ases : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the body fat distribution ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( bone loss ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; am@@ bush is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of am@@ bush in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is reduced by 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule , therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing add @-@ ons of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ eth@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use should be cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of am@@ bush and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dosing of as@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a may be altered , but information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ i@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl g@@ utter content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 , see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an extinction of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate for the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions to the liver were observed very frequently . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s Wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , 50 % is increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ mine values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the sac@@ ral component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and am@@ bush are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the gift of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ases would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; should this medicine be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of concur@@ rent administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg ket@@ ac@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x by K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ D ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ times daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , may result in interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs , if they are applied in combination with ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to resor@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rim odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ generative with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in plasma levels at the same time are expected to be expected . &quot;
&quot; as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , am@@ bush should not be applied together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the use of am@@ eth@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable . &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ases point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on op@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation as to how the Am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is at the same time administered with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation agents together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as the use of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk @-@ lac@@ ing rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduction in the 12 body weight during pregnancy showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the as@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , rose early and rarely lead to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1,@@ 200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash was usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ cu@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ esters with the result of an education un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral untreated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 50@@ V , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations occurred : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A , and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a transplan@@ ting therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the efficacy of am@@ en@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose &quot; &quot; Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI , and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children of the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; am@@ per@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , 50 % is increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration at the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when they are given concur@@ r@@ ently with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; in solution , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a mil@@ gram@@ m@@ basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses ranging from 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; trials on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with an age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; during systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing add @-@ ons of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ eth@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous use should be cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 , see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , 50 % is increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ mine values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ ases would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rim odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation agents together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be applied only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduction in the weight of the body weight during pregnancy showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; car@@ re@@ ase should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval fluctu@@ ates depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration at the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when they are given concur@@ r@@ ently with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of a kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses ranging from 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; trials on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with an age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ isation paths are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; bitten &quot; &quot; A@@ generative solution for intake was not documented in patients treated with PI , neither with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is reduced by 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule , therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ lagen , A@@ generative solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of this medicine and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , 50 % is increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration is expected to significantly increase plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the potential risk for humans is not to be used during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk @-@ lac@@ ing rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;

your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ val@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of am@@ bush .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test and your treatment history carried out by your doctor .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the drugs listed above .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting treatment . &quot;
&quot; also , there is no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect of children between 4 and 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur . &quot;

it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid a transmission of HIV .
transportation and operation of machines There have been no studies on the influence of am@@ bush on the driving ability or ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ather@@ ase can be reduced . &quot;
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; if your doctor decides that the intake of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; 85 So , it is very important that you take the whole daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of am@@ per@@ ase than you should have taken if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ ase If you have forgotten taking ather@@ ase , take it once you think about it and then continue taking as far away . &quot;

dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; therefore , it is very important that you take the whole daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken greater amounts of as@@ gener@@ ase than you should have taken if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of as@@ gener@@ ase , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , a fat gain at the stomach and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat sw@@ ell@@ ings in the neck ( &quot; &quot; sti@@ ckers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , acet@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum fragrance , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • At ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , it is performed five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks interval between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and carried out al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either a day or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p with immun@@ expert adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before entering the bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has been continued until all visible in@@ clin@@ ations have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was left out , the patient should wear the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in a thin layer and rub into the puri@@ fied skin area infected with in@@ clin@@ ations , until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous topical remedies for the treatment of external in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and peripher@@ y area there are no clinical experiences yet .
&quot; limited data suggests an increased rate of incl@@ ination reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair approach has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions are back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with rec@@ ci@@ dent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , so such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fo@@ etal development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although non @-@ recurring topical application of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) has not been achieved , no recommendation can be used during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most common adverse events reported and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study are shown below .
&quot; the most common , most likely or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects associated with placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sch@@ or@@ f@@ formation and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is far superior .
&quot; at 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the in@@ clin@@ ations healed completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , 5 % from 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five weeks of application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary primary cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external cow@@ ards , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) . &quot;
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream due to the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ value time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s resor@@ ption was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased mil@@ eage ; a study carried out four months for the der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ able , a risk to humans is regarded as very small because of systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; may harm other people even if these same symptoms have same as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● Fe@@ eding war@@ ts ( con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( gen@@ itals ) and anus ( anus ) ● Surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a commonly encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to ab@@ norm@@ alities , especially in the face - therefore an early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other , similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before you start treatment . o inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane . &quot;
&quot; if there are reactions to the treated area that are causing you severe in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties may occur when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during infection with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is performed . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od enters the breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of in@@ clin@@ ations , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the in@@ clin@@ ations and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
men with in@@ clin@@ ations under the fores@@ kin must re@@ tract the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath it ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

&quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain sooner or you can cause a depression .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , there are lighter skin reactions that may sound again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes on the application site ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application site ( blood , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , s@@ wollen and scar@@ ring ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane , c@@ logged nose , flu or flu @-@ like symptoms , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung capacity , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction prior to administration . &quot;

&quot; the study investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its efficacy in terms of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under 5 years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated rate of heart ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approval for the allocation of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient dies this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been established and no dosage pattern can be recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure were not detected , and no dosage pattern can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion process ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ alization facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to occur within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , caution must be handled carefully . &quot;
to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ ro@@ c@@ rest ) .
&quot; in the event of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereas in the age of 5 patients with a more severe follow @-@ up form usually resulted in a serum version within one month ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ conc@@ ede . &quot;
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust decline in the G@@ AG level in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable decrease of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in Phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely above man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the vi@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop in the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into consideration clin@@ ically significant changes across five levels of efficacy ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , overall improvement was observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with the heavy tra@@ verse form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma @-@ dosage schemes were carried out on G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the authorisation for the in@@ verter has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which cle@@ ars certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is absent . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic to one of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion process ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of dimin@@ ished effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for use - th@@ inning and applying the concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increases every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - condition involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing life and ob@@ verse ede@@ ma occurred . &quot;
&quot; extremely common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion point &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; Anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given prior to or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood condition changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells had longer survival compared with the comparative medicine in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. , a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given on the day before and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) per week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient pays the attention prior to treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 years an increased side effect risk exists .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
&quot; the data layer in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sposition @-@ values of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone @-@ bone res@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients , before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils regain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; reduced toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated , if pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the associated toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is planned , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damaging of the reproductive capacity is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment order to obtain advice regarding the locking of the sper@@ mat@@ o@@ zo@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed secre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects . &quot;
caution is required if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used in high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed avoided ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for using p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - rigid an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely required and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the lock @-@ up lashing . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed enters the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and were random@@ ized to random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 phase 2 p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy studies ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that might be possible in connection with study medication ; they were random@@ ized to &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ities that were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who received random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - omet@@ ri@@ zed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed included :
&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .

&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ at with multiple attack points by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ ti@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ re@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ in@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma , showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , patients treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centre , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 61 @-@ 1,@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a separately controlled , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin over 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total counting interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ compliance threshold of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutical were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be re @-@ found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the more advanced epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; unless otherwise applied , the retention times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the contents of the 100 mg diameter bottles with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; 23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy , in the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer . &quot;
&quot; if you have kidney disease or earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , as you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion of blood tests ; it checks if your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
&quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin gift . &quot;
&quot; if you have a fluid collection around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this liquid before you receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to become a child during treatment or in the first 6 months after the treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions Please tell your doctor if you are taking drugs against pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as medicines called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , including drugs that are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned da@@ in@@ ty of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; a hospital pharmacy , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with ster@@ ility 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you . &quot;

&quot; in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) . &quot;
&quot; in this use information , a side effect is described as &quot; very frequent &quot; means that it has been reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; frequently , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 100 patients , but was reported less than 1 out of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; occasionally &quot; , &quot; this implies that it has been reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 out of 100 patients . if a side effect is described as &quot; rare , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients . &quot;
&quot; fever or infection ( frequent ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or have other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;
&quot; if you feel tired or weak , fall short in breath or look pale ( because you may have less ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;

&quot; dissolve the contents of the 500 mg per@@ fusion bottles with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % natural sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality .
&quot; it is applied in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot drain some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats covered with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took all@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ b finish , chair @-@ strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract are absorbed ) or chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) and pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric and fat @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Stop time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ ancies in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation agents in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a one @-@ time dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of unwanted side effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to alterations in terms of potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight test subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in most of the cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects can be traced back to the li@@ pas@@ genic properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ische and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ as .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin amounted to or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; with waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic doses , non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , given the minimal system@@ ically resor@@ bed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the overall plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be detected for humans . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation system must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

the weight reduction is used for overweight adults aged 18 and over with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in combination with a low @-@ fat and calorie @-@ reduced diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your body size or are overweight .
&quot; even if these diseases first do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a check @-@ up examination . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used for organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines which have a blood @-@ dil@@ uting effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral and increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or ann@@ ul@@ led if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
&quot; before taking all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • Take A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as . • Apply A@@ carb@@ ose to treat diabetes . &quot;
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure , you may need to adjust the dosage . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the blue sides in Section 6 , see further helpful information on how to set your calorie and fat boundaries . &quot;
&quot; if you have a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body on the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ ori@@ - and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; diet di@@ aries are effective , as you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably fall more easily to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Ap@@ po@@ ise fat to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during the intake and after the intake of all@@ i .
&quot; • If you cannot find any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; • In case of successful weight loss , it is not important to change the diet for a short term and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , do not take any capsule . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , as you may have not yet reduced the amount of fat in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ in some days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat reduced diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Dis@@ cover your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases , such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • Stro@@ ke • Cer@@ tified cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talking to your doctor about your risk for these diseases . &quot;
&quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum per day . &quot;
notice the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , please refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Up@@ on the mode of operation of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body can &apos;t handle that amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related atten@@ tions . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes gar@@ dening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Me@@ aning is a nutrition diary with information about the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically more active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate release of nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is provided with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that leng@@ then the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy drug , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five evaluated chemical agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ duc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron &apos;s experience in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common side @-@ effects observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be related to Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ lig@@ ation over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results from the studies of moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. det@@ ectable pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration following an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are usually dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ / kg in healthy dogs and cancer patients .
&quot; following intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) measured in 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) comparable to the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ able of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in dogs , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function have increased the terminal elimination rate and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ oid exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 For prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the action rate . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and since alo@@ xi is intended for unique applications , the relevance of these results is very low for people . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the affir@@ mation of the per@@ ver@@ ting of the drug intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medical reference &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue is damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are elevated . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which encourages this to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were treated ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in the absence of sufficient data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease decreased again in more patients than in the reference medical device ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug generates an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected lesi@@ ons ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ drug Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go does not have an impact on this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the percentage of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ - filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the site .
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small cargo units , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment di@@ lig@@ ently wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection begins . &quot;
retri@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as pathogens or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ sive skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 m@@ g. of ket@@ ac@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on abra@@ sive skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotics . &quot;
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the site was about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ac@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; through binding at this site , pe@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infections seem question@@ able , advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples took place in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in the human being after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid alterations . &quot;
in @-@ vitro test on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 , or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ) : &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of one of two doses of the existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix children approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ality ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active ingredients ) one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies , observed after pri@@ ming with the combination vaccine , are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully safegu@@ ar@@ ded whether immuno@@ competent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her process as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in the case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with immune system disorders , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is achieved following pri@@ ming ir@@ regul@@ arization , so that further vacc@@ ination doses may be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time in the form of a separate injection with combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there might be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ality , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ salt and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix were about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was observed with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of ino@@ cul@@ ations that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination pattern .
&quot; the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that , which was determined after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the imaging of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us @-@ flu vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates similar to the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through food containing viruses and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in waters contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus prior to the administration of both ino@@ cul@@ ars Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . &quot;
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle for people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child are taking further medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated recently , or if you have received immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or have been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information on specific mis@@ cell@@ aneous parts of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP insi@@ sts that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ opo@@ esis can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or hyper@@ activity en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since am@@ mon@@ opo@@ ei@@ a could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( placebo , i.e. without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mo@@ sis in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; am@@ mon@@ opo@@ esis was approved , because only limited information was available to this drug due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use , if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early mani@@ um deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate sy@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate equivalent to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ mat@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is administered via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least an adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events assumed they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
&quot; ga@@ chi@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is recorded for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine produced . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no cla@@ im@@ al effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ a or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early mani@@ um deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate sy@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons were found in the pyramid cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; ga@@ chi@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess liquid . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it is possible to assume that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is recorded for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes a small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into mother &apos;s milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headaches , pal@@ p@@ ation problems , om@@ is@@ sions of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , feel free to contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , pal@@ p@@ ation , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , skin rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal lab results . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the box and the container according to &quot; User until &quot; exp@@ iry date .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS into the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stomach fi@@ erc@@ ate ( hose , which runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ules from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox@@ in is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients were often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of AC@@ S was angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients ) . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emer@@ gen@@ cies or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if in other cases a PCI is carried out , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous captive bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular heat treatment .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ stom@@ y system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in arter@@ ial spots in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the course of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again reaching the level prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Units ) can be assumed to increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked . &quot;
&quot; the animal experimental investigations are insufficient regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ date alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ j@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ ant din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding area , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ classes . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is immediately interrupted and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ ologically ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ im is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce any th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia
&quot; in healthy volunteers and patients , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was conducted following a PCI test , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in arm A AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift attacks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the three arms . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid components with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary met@@ abo@@ ol@@ ite , which results from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or insulin does not work effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from Human@@ insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin delivery , insulin needs in patients with a reduction of liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change in the effect of the action , the brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 . insufficient dosage or ab@@ ort of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time for the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ reducing activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ cor@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ vation , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c antagon@@ ism can be or are missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid concerning pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine enters into human breast milk but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the Un@@ desirable Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs that have become known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ classes and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ per@@ spir@@ ation , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes in vision , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If neglected to continuously switch the injection site inside the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or treated by a doctor by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with cou@@ ghing or normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal Human@@ insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ insulin .
&quot; the data showed that a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin was taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the meal starts , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
