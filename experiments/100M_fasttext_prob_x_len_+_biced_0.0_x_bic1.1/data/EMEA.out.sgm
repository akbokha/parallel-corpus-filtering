<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal sentiment."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have approached the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are removed as well as Abilify, the dosage of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through neurotransmitters, that is, chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably appears primarily as a "partial agent" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for inserting (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased unrest than those receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"even more effective than placebo, Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), sensation (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, vomiting, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changes of an anti-psychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazzol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify have signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events was treated with Aripiprazzol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolisers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>

<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphian)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="71">"adverse events related to antipsychotic therapies, and about their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in treating an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is of benefit, as Aripiprazzol has a high plasma rating."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is conveyed by the combination of a partial diagonal effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergies and histamine-H1receptors."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazzol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazzol showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">"in adults and adolescents aged 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are cleared."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relieved on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever syndrome reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from hypersensitivity (allergic to hypoatadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from congestion (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis) or a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company to authorize Aerinaze to operate throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is generally swallowed (i.e. without biting it, breaking or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued if necessary with desloratadin as monotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy."</seg>

<seg id="1679">"in the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"in the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not they were taken with alcohol alone or with alcohol."</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting, and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the safety of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancy did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a lightheadedness that can lead to impairment of perspiration or ability to operate machinery."</seg>

<seg id="1688">"CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (oral dryness, pupil starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms)."</seg>
<seg id="1689">"these include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / baseophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the inhibitory molecule P-Seltin on endothelial cells."</seg>
<seg id="1690">"in a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on the standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the gain of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"in controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily."</seg>

<seg id="1694">"in both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"in terms of gender, age or ethnicity, the efficacy of ainaze tablets did not show any significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration of the plasma."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity in repeated administration, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any special dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine."</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous course of the disease and can be resumed after the symptoms of the symptoms and resumed during their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">"in case of persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), an ongoing treatment can be recommended to patients during the allergy period."</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">"in a clinical pharmacological study, the effective effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"however, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to lightheadedness which can lead to impairment of perspiration or ability to operate machinery."</seg>
<seg id="1736">"in clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="1737">"the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%)."</seg>
<seg id="1738">"in a clinical study involving 578 juvenile patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="1739">"in a multi-dose study, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed."</seg>
<seg id="1740">"this includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / baseophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the inhibitory molecule P-Seltin on endothelial cells."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days."</seg>

<seg id="1744">"in patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"in addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis."</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">"as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis."</seg>
<seg id="1749">"the chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of aetiology, is similar in the different forms and can be easily prospectively recruited to chronic patients."</seg>
<seg id="1750">"since histamine replacement is an causative factor in all primitive diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines."</seg>
<seg id="1751">"in two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the size and number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval."</seg>
<seg id="1752">"as in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistaminika was excluded from the study."</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness significantly as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">"in a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients."</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"however, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded."</seg>
<seg id="1758">"in-vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins."</seg>
<seg id="1759">"in a single dose study with loratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not work on the availability of desloratadin."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"the preclinical studies carried out with desloratadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin, and Loratadin."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the affirmation of the perverting of the drug intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A, which has already been approved in the EU (also called" "reference medical reference" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue is damaged, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are elevated."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA), which encourages this to the formation of the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"in the study, it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were treated (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in the absence of sufficient data for the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease decreased again in more patients than in the reference medical device; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug generates an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lesions (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used for treating infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillindrug Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo does not have an impact on this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the percentage of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (eiter- filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small cargo units, abrasions, or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment diligently wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection begins."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retriamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on abrasive skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg. of ketacconazole, the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on abrasive skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adaptations are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"during pregnancy, Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo have applied, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the site was about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passacerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"through binding at this site, peleuromutiline inhibit peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some infections seem questionable, advice should be targeted by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were found in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples took place in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in the human being after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of smeared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"Metabolism The in vitro-oxidative metabolites of retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid alterations."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is applied within the framework of one of two doses of the existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be brought to an end from two doses."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or any other hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can fight against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine Twinrix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine Twinrix children approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturality (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic to the active ingredients) one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated."</seg>
<seg id="2741">"the anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies, observed after priming with the combination vaccine, are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines."</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully safeguarded whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, need a refresher process as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in the case of no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with immune system disorders, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is achieved following priming irregularization, so that further vaccination doses may be required in these cases."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in the case of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was administered at the same time in the form of a separate injection with combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1)."</seg>

<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or insulin does not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting humanoid."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body can not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisp."</seg>

<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with coughing or normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
