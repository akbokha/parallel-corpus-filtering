&quot; you can compile the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras website . select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire site URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert translated text directly . &quot;
&quot; the package and package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ ons .... open the box tools , and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that some more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the module Moun@@ ting Fil@@ ters ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Moun@@ ting Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects using the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if it is far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the inter@@ oc@@ ation depth or the image of a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display ( whereby therefore display errors can be used by limitations on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . &quot;
&quot; as partition of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . it is important for the labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through the frame in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View Sam@@ ples in area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a revol@@ ving field to set the number of thumb@@ nails every line in the gallery .
&quot; to show the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , see if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to display the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
with the check box image size indicate whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the Fol@@ der Fol@@ der , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the File Sel@@ ection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set a slider or a control panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original pictures with the original pictures to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the comments file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box &apos;s own color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with short@@ cuts F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; changing browser identi@@ fiers adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , with which you can change browsing and operating system recognition for single domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting . &quot;
with the menu entry Con@@ figuration ... you can set the scope of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
&quot; with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module , check your &amp; CSS ; Style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with W3@@ C &apos;s recommendations and other standards . &quot;
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras website . you can make the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check test if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds , all found errors will be displayed . with this review , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together . &quot;
&quot; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de , programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and possibilities of improvement . &quot;
&quot; whenever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would encourage you to answer questions about other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ bian Library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &quot;
you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ bian List have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you can easily handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported blank cameras in the Help menu help . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; edited ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function , as the changes made in &amp; digi@@ cam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the lateral bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures anywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to fold the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering is shown on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ bian settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ dings or after the date the album was created first . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you must right @-@ click on the album and select the album features in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method of marking your albums so you can group them under a common name . the collection created by you will be used to sort your photos after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums After date sort .
&quot; buttons The oldest , average , new : they set the date to the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . to do this , the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information is tried first . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait for a moment while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . which information is , you can edit it via Settings ; set up the albums page and customize the range of preview images to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the preview images have help window , which appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such help window . &quot;
&quot; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them . you can select all the features that are made with &amp; digi@@ plug . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section you can see a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view and change your photos .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . for this , and how to customize them , find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . by doing so , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My date limit quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; images with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos displayed with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; to fold , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the key words are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either to &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ title of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click on the preview of the pictures and select from the contex@@ tual menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can choose a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window when previ@@ ew@@ ing the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the pop @-@ up menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords they have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline display shows a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower right of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the images will be displayed . if the search has not found , then the lamp will rot . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be selected in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit Search , the search form appears again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option may be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it . any option may be associated with other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... Cre@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . if you move a picture from anywhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : hand @-@ made sket@@ ches : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ cam ; find the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag or zoom in or out of the mouse button . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , requires your pictures to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ table from the context menu . the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window opens .
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area to see . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you are using pair @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas to the same . now use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal sol@@ der actions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in p@@ anning function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process following the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos scans , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect , protect , convert , convert , group , backup , review , sample , archive , review , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide if other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you are making enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files match together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original files and files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; edited ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign each photograph keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the tree within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are updated by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ tree . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer , to help him over the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; you can put it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time for the publication . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as an information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the identity of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the image to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; nbsp ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section we deal with problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control tot@@ als . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . afterwards , you should check the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and off @-@ animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing erg@@ ents include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk failure study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect this error . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT are the most common error reason . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . so you can protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for lap@@ tops and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security for energy disrup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can take you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive compared to hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity of the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day open a photo and this was destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks , however , amounts to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture setting of fundamental physical limits . it means that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so , do not blame anyone else for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbour house , in your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system with the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ assess while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to get a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store it to a new disk : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of stimulus if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the needs of the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon even at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers drag it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . they may be cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; to add a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; tab Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the Met@@ adata page strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam , and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folder sorted , displayed . the list of the existing albums is shown in the My Albums section . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only a few , you must select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos are not downloaded in the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they are deleted completely . if you want to delete the camera files completely , you should do this via the camera system , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ lic@@ ating photos of various shooting series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been made in the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three other options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % M in the editing field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your ren@@ ame settings are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window for the next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording , in order to automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually turned on and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn off this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ Based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in length and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first of all , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transferring the data to a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module . &quot;
there are several programs for Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ marked coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Settings menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing can be set . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; note when you click on an entry in the main screen .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture to other &amp; quot ; offer@@ . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without losing .
&quot; save cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , whenever you open the lumin@@ table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression level . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can turn the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very quickly becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image slightly soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a penet@@ rating white . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as they show the top lights in various roses . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as quickly as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ stru@@ t option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pf ; image editing . in order to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure . &quot;
&quot; V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction , as it is performed during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the colour information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in image editing / start color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Fol@@ der the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
&quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures do not manage the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , who do not have color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors will therefore be very saturated . this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de , image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then uploaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the previ@@ ews . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left side show a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera with your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera models and ports manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to stop when starting . this speeds under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; the setting When you search for new photos , you need to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited , to adjust the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you can find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or by clicking the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry . &quot;
&quot; image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; edited , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; editing functions of image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or button The Rest@@ ore of Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting undo / restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full @-@ screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can view it in the Settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change it from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window . see the section for setting up image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File picture menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select the printer from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is , without the navigation file , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the application button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key tree and a selection box with previously used keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by checking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image will be stored in the keyword in the keyword IP@@ TC .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords in the main screen . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then , a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled in settings different .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and the rule range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are the same from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to link your monitor , since s@@ RGB is running the circle . if you are working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either link your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment and Con@@ trast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction menu automatically attempt to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what best works with your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the thick@@ nesses across the picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the maximum range and a re@@ design of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side , you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . &quot;
the preview of the destination image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram is shown on the top right , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you set , you can now store it into a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as used for processing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is to find ton@@ value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner is always the same error and you always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partially developed print was replaced by the additional light . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . finally , a further increase creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition by &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ starch / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog on this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to post@@ p@@ one the control and look at how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . images of a digital camera often contain the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output value : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators which can be used to change the output value inter@@ actively as with the input rate . for example , the compression of the output value can be used to create a burned @-@ out image as background while something else is in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and Store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . this is used to use the Gim@@ p Levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and solar tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; see below for an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . in this case , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and the corresponding image pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it then up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sunny tones . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed in comparison with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you also change the color components . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour@@ less is made up of small noise files that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic solar effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simulated a black / white film direction with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
se@@ ep@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ asing a pressure and the re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . the picture is surrounded by a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image that is decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before cutting before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image template apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam , please send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template file . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look shar@@ per . in fact , it does not improve a bit , it works rather psych@@ ically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adjust .
photos without focus and most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter already during reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be viewed with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ tive sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; you should be careful with this , as the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also intensi@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can get further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cra@@ cking . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . &quot;
the radio shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ per image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing results usually achieve better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value 1 should result in good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is g@@ ossi@@ p . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by sharpen@@ ing the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharp@@ correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address . &quot;
the slider sets the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this checks the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the picture . &quot;
&quot; directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD h@@ iss , a high value will generate wa@@ vy @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally it is enough 1 or 2 .
&quot; angular gra@@ dient da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to leave it out . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad movie deposit during the journey .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius monitors the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can wipe the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter will no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can not remove the whole noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process of the image settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche noise , film gran@@ ul@@ as , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is performed using a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make this exactly . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph caused by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the Hot@@ pixel tool allows Hot@@ pixel to remove photos using a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark@@ Image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and loads it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
&quot; select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available : &quot;
&quot; average : it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure area of today &apos;s film and the color or grey depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that has been made without this filter . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random a light intensity of 2 . &quot;
&quot; adjusting the image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls provide only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; picture editing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ k@@ ening and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth grade correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , this value controls the strength of the second degree of distortion . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction afterwards , the effect would be apparent to the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the picture preview to see the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ers cutting from image editing or using the zoom control of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots of front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters to adjust film gran@@ ul@@ atory and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add Film F@@ ew if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ atory and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows will know how snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter paints color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ding on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers are mixing large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the lines , which define the outline in the drawing , are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower one adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it has been stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is looked through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom blur@@ r : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
ran@@ ge@@ ance : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ er@@ sharpen@@ fe : blur@@ ring the picture through random shifting of the pixels , thus simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can stop with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes good work here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is checked , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons &quot; &quot; Save as and Lo@@ ad &quot; &quot; are used exactly to do this . enlarge each inser@@ tion for photo can be stored as a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to crop a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be ed@@ ged by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Add button of Image Processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to page ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait mode , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to page ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the translation help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third gel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden middle provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not identical tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can make a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options and mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are set in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
once you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular openings in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally crop function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get immense tri@@ angular openings at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , turns the top part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line will be displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have completed the sc@@ aling , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes are twice as much blur@@ ring and so you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sc@@ aling , the image has ugly tri@@ angular openings in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; edited . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the file in the image editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions , and edit it . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guid@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports loading crude pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; it supports more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in ways to view or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description will follow here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft signs , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , Un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
&quot; the left area shows the original and the right , for comparison , the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag or zoom in or out of the mouse button . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , requires your pictures to contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is selected by the cur@@ sor , the color is inserted from the color table on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing has been selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . if so , three numbers are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .

&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed and old ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file currently in the graph viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ene file outside of a running &amp; k@@ art viewer , eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; instance or want to present the graph in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog afterwards . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that comes to a page should be cli@@ pped to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without head@@ line , and with another font &quot;
&quot; the Renew@@ able Store page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of the graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session , or not ) or decide to be asked at every start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which appears usually at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens additional possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here , you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ lay@@ ered graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change the graph with a filter before being drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ structured graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . click a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can find further options in the Settings menu .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot;
&quot; once you have made no step backward , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey levels . this can create colors that do not match those of the icon palette of &amp; k@@ de .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right shows you the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three sides templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the Tem@@ plates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display ruler and place Uni@@ coloured : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner display . you can also set the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and big as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools for reading new images and saving them .
&quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a sc@@ anners supported by the San@@ e Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default value duc@@ er to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click on the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings might not be displayed . &quot;
after pressing the button Scan@@ nen you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected the Import - &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the full desktop to read out to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send your photos to the people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos in a safe and private way to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need to write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width degrees are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog shown above appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore , the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have no trace data from a location for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality , a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog shows the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the relevant region and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . the option For each image will create a page created a gallery in which each image will also get a separate page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your images . select a folder on which you have a write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . push Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please take a look at exi@@ v2 to see what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coding Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module m@@ peg enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG @-@ Sli@@ deshow . after that , you can create the module via Extras m@@ peg Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to return the file to a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button at the bottom . &quot;
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print it directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters like g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can zoom or zoom the image . there are four types of image change available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop them down to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after selecting all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG from the file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button closure , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
show the fil@@ en@@ ame option for displaying the file name of the images in the left lower corner of the presentation .
&quot; the option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop , then you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
the option images random@@ ly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for you . &quot;
&quot; when you press people with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display preview images to view the images of your area of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the name , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image preview window ( described in more detail ) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can preview this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for . the date can be either a part of the overall date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you can see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the User Manual for &amp; Photo Album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; Co @-@ photo@@ album , and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; purchase photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you &apos;re a photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview icon ) and the time bar displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual you will find the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can call over the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on photo album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . by doing so , you can avoid that information is displayed that are visible to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . by doing so , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a root folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this will enable you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can verify that these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the just described settings are related to all three on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file . the advantage of all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and this file can be shared so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important feature of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; photo@@ album with the Automati@@ cally near the .@@ k@@ im file ; the pictures automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the size of the image . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send them in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... , you will be able to import the exported database as described in it . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import pictures should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window to import the categories of the imported file and what categories they correspond to in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to search and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos too . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder in which your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the different settings .
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in dialog Options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the list box listed above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I , meaning &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules are using via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order doesn &apos;t support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; Co @-@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category people , you will be used &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the image has been taken . for example , each image can be displayed individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view of three lists with a text field , you can specify persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you type information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , by moving the names used up , find people faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sort by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may wish to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with comments . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons below the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the top right . &quot;
&quot; if you have added multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all those images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it down to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which allows you , among other things , the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to get this window back later , use the Options button ... and then fade out the window . see this procedure in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or any pictures if you have no filter . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is created as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the preview preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select the Edit selection menu . now , the window will show you that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use the pictures anywhere , with it &amp; CD album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it again . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those of you who want to make your little sister open and click on the menu entry All out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password , which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , everyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to forbi@@ d the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via an image _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the p@@ ush@@ buttons image high and thumb@@ . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; S. &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in the middle of the picture . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the button key sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out zo@@ oms are with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the screen@@ shot functions from the contex@@ tual menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can see the image ab@@ ort and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with characteristics while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have features on your images , these are available in your browser . you can see this in your browser . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview preview . if you want to view categories in dre preview , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will be allowed to get a photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later . &quot;
in the picture you can see a picture on the picture painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the contex@@ tual menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not fully rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the Add @-@ in menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the contex@@ tual menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with a error description will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the User Docum@@ entation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a viewing level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are only shown when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the selected point of view of the scene in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , pull the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , draw the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the card @-@ tra@@ cker at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to get a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the little left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window ordering ... to save it . it displays a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modes ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol of the render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or model effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always separated and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam per pixel . if the difference between the colour values to the neighbouring pixels is exceeded , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
group of abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately pursued and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams um a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit the object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can include source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object value of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the ground , a floor is rendered below the objects . the ground is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick this tab , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details about parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ modes section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window order section explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of window orders already exists shows all the existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot;
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten , you will get a map view together with the previous view and floating in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before making sure that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window order : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( on the right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the application button or press the button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite body header ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can see the name in the property tree ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Pig@@ ment Pre@@ view shows just a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on previ@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and sphere in the preview , just click on the user button and then preview the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to apply the touch button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , the sphere gives a pigment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the button .
&quot; the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler can do . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ produces the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have used undo . &quot;
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option , you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ eler with this option . &quot;
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
&quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture mapping .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created by dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Set@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when loading the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
with this option the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large pictures . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute its part to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; here , we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
the best way to get involved is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&quot; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; change . to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to view . exposure should display a light color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in image processing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tab :
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer can scan , scan and save images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . for each image , you can open a dialog for saving or save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; output ; with the command channel l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can first start a preview can and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and S@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; users can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; to automatically store it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select Save without asking a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save option without having to ask a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE Over -@@ Dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; .
&quot; &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L , and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like any other program short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking the player window and setting up the short@@ cuts ... &quot;
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which are also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function may look like : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
comprehen@@ sion require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which each K@@ DE installation should be . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece can be retri@@ eved ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths allows you to use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove the menu . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script pack@@ ets that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with a cat@@ tering cat@@ amar@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right away . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you can also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can &apos;t decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re @-@ experience your music ! &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements section . &quot;
&quot; activate Deb@@ u@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort via setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition to displaying the player window , the player window will also turn on or off in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use m@@ ood@@ bar with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
more atmospheric : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; store mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save Play@@ list when loading , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; turn on this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when loading . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible while changing the piece , makes the playlist window open / un@@ rolled to keep the current piece in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray outlined section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , Player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the drop @-@ down dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection selected below for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the point with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for type@@ face and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should be the O@@ SD . &quot;
the box audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the sub@@ window of My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is designed to support last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your load@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
calls similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small manual on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager initi@@ ates the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and let the collection again .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading Met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this will crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens when you crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but don &apos;t mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error if there is something about fixing a defect in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist appears .
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the interface , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you &apos;ll find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From playlist removing from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist , and drop them down there , just as you would also do with other files . as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the add button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which media types are supporting G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are included in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 CD , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media must be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes your data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . register register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run you @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; please report to bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magical K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have arous@@ ed from the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the button on a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ able functions , but how does the icon in the system section of the control strip look like ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically add files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM , &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a declining value based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can change the evaluation for a piece yourself by clicking the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ click on the piece and press : select the review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you &apos;re supposed to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release schedule that does not match the short @-@ term added plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design install .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and check &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select the Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio rob@@ bers are fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to install and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you must re@@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you don &apos;t have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also has to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module . &quot;
you will receive the error of There is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output specify the device . typically is h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check box on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being looked after . you can of course also take this problem into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed assistant for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide should be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easy to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist , and you will find it in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD here .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; speci@@ fies the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start the playback / stop and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de , available multimedia players . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and performer . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ windows start off . the information shown here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window shows information about the current piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you can find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name will be treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; next area , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist .
&quot; you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on the right mouse button , and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts written from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;

&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists , which use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of : &quot;
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; also created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be used with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod by performer in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar is a search area that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping files . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter characters there , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter separated search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok , search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one of two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 , and not the commentary bad . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you can find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that , which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars there ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . by doing so , you can disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the visualization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .

the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your major entry into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number appears next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these follow later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces while playing . &quot;

&quot; double @-@ click on the playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ assed and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while recording pla@@ ym@@ ate pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will be added ; random pieces from each of the playlist will be added . &quot;

&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ desirable effect that the pieces of music are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and to automatically play all videos in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As will appear with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file .
&quot; when a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what to do with it , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not stored there will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the pop @-@ up dialog . this has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above . what is this ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to import files from a previous session to the current project . it is useful for you to include files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more likely to be used for you to see the files and folders already available on the media .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , to remove imported files from the current project . &quot;
&quot; this allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also want cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD that you can burn later on . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used all @-@ in @-@ one . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the submitted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , as long as a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on call screen . this dialog is designed for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is key to which of the accompanying programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void @-@ format@@ ted ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : str@@ ur@@ ls , Q@@ String ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ Qu@@ path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Tracker for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders who encoding these wa@@ v files ( compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ ders need to be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; what encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to circum@@ vent copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setup must be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; explains to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; pick up information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , and everything is manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , further information on how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data will start in the CD@@ DB tab according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet must be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the Code encoding settings in the setup directory - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read out as the default . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pic@@ ots ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main set dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex pieces of music and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without considering the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of programming settings for enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs , upload the information instead of entering the machine itself . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only be known by the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reader program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on it and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords . &quot;
&quot; you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine since it is considered non @-@ free software . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reader program so it can read the &amp; CD ; - data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the map General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD , entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , please keep in mind that if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if it &apos;s worth it . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp will exist on your computer )
&quot; simultaneous reading and coding at the same time ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is around 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files simultaneously to be enco@@ ded : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to code more than a wa@@ v file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs to the hard disk . we will create and set MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard disk is organized , has been written in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; collect data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , look in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
&quot; e 1.2 , step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece &quot;
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current titles &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the tab card settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . look for the enco@@ der in order to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously does not match the style of the CD . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title details of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the BO@@ M list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or out . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ ec@@ es at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out of the selection process started , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in MP3 format . this means reading and coding parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . the best way to read the step by step is to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this kind of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately not an e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . and if you want to read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Project Driver which is needed for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; if you &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two kinds in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . however , if you select the entry Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function will also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the threads in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence after the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Kara@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next Song button , the next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to turn round a song back to jump , select the Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; if so , if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the word drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the same drum ( as some of the key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel . look at the included key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for that channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , you will always use patch x . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio exists in which ratio of pitch Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event , should play a tone higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are currently being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can select an instrument . &quot;
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the Channel View menu : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with me ( if you want to ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I only need to continue programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , fault noti@@ fications or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you can also find links to sites with other Kara@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Categ@@ ory playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you log in , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and persistent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; S@@ ME ; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / KM@@ Player / , can also be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the menu and choose either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / KM@@ Player / KM@@ Player / DATA@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / KM@@ Player / DATA@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt
&quot; there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the S@@ ME configuration dialog , where you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Players ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / w@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog File assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME ; is used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . the gest@@ ate process is called kn@@ pp@@ layer . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ ME ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this will always be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; S@@ ME ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . this can be used to manually edit the scanner from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog will be used in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( for example is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally , S@@ ME uses various names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ and@@ source . &quot;
is there any hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play off it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after the device is inserted . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts up slowly but why does each time my CPU have to be checked for performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is used for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ ck@@ eting . &quot;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be returned to the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website included .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile &amp; check , please refer to the list box Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .@@ net@@ . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while only a good overview at &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ _ day class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick @-@ entry wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
&quot; this explains the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : with this , the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the usually used add @-@ on packs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they will only have to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - the emphasis on used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; box ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and effort by high@@ lighting . &quot;
&quot; by automatically completing the settings , a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the box settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ section the lowest element ) :
&quot; when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI @-@ file . as soon as a DVI , file &#91; is an independent D e V ice I n@@ depen@@ File &#93; &#93; , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like font , and is next to PDF the available output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; using the bridge search , the elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ gged along with the editor and as soon as an element has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is given . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is any error in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is designed to be called &quot; &quot; over @-@ monitored &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box For further information is available for items such as keywords , key notes or references . the available options include : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a term for a section , a picture or a different element . &quot;
cover : used for reference to a specified designation ( choose a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files may also be written in &amp; box ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for defining the characters . the characters can be set for the main text , the key notes , etc . , the following letters are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the Assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . when using Fast Construction , you should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few por@@ ches should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allow the change of the characters within the environment to be called &quot; &quot; king &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { ex@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be cur@@ sively displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows now . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be executed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ um@@ wand@@ ler or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are needed as required for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI , file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . only Modern under Settings box must be set up ... tools build @-@ out .
&quot; to execute the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on to the preview search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer then takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; added to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; set in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if an error occurs when using the Quick Construction &amp; DVI file , an error may occur . if an error occurs , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the buttons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . the log file always indicates the error in the log and &amp; box ; jumps to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be created or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in a document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Program &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex , files created . if a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ sters ; used as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called over the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; you can find use as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a dr@@ um@@ ber Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for the most diverse types of source texts and highlight it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional boun@@ ce marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¤ u@@ ge edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding key jack have the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump token , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent options have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are always many environments and groups , and therefore supported &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has a back@@ lash ( \ \ ) command and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to enable a part of the document , it may be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a more straightforward work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly lose the overview above . this command completes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands which correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ sor bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor occurs before or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly groups par@@ enth@@ eses you can quickly get lost . this command completes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple add @-@ ons are used as genes . for the purpose @-@ giving implementation , the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple signs . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double lock token can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; there may also be a number of specific settings ( e.g. , n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French startup characters . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; by pressing Shift ; enter the button ; enter a smart line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a spread@@ sheet environment , complete the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion offers , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still extended . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box ... Complete . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed during the selection of a command . alternatively , you can add boun@@ ce marks to these positions , so that a simply jump to these positions is possible by means of the best jump brand and the checked parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete can be made to these lists . there can be different number lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ ies of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the call of full operation will have a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a special mode for the completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete change mode over the menu Edit or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment will automatically be filed and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as you see that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be filled with . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of full@@ time mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box . as an example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word dis@@ sem@@ ination mode over the menu Edit Complete shut@@ down or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar is introduced , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large quantities of goods are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been established that many users are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete can be switched off . here , the threshold value for displaying the complete damage can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the per@@ s@@ able home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphic design dialog designs graphics as simple as possible . to super@@ v@@ ise the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are compiled in groups in the compilation , converting and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion , the key element Alt ; 2 can be used . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted by Alt ; 4 using the DVI ; file into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Construction command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no inserted viewer is used , a new window will appear each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project is about the Men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... In this case , the following information is requested for the project : &quot;
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet finished yet , and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all too &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and here for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the desired advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ led and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day , you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ o@@ ving in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot;

&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the DT@@ D ; using definition @-@ UR@@ I ; select the definition UR@@ I ; required in file selection . &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , be selected , then let the current file be selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be copied with the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have been la@@ yed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . they can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the thread in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , and the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more on it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins in the menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on notes .
&quot; apart from the overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is added to CVS , once it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how these conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
input ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . it can either be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters but spaces around the brackets and : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : large / case @-@ sensitive by tags : large / case @-@ sensitive by automatically inserted tags . normal gross / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ .@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Klein@@ ortho@@ graphy of attributes : large / case @-@ sensitive by automatically inserted attributes . normal gross / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ .@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; lock optional Tags : when checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; update start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of accent notes : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during ti@@ pping .
&quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default button , the default settings can be restored . &quot;
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other way than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . &quot;
&quot; backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a Cart@@ ridge ) , making it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / descending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning area is used to control the display of warnings by un@@ checking the warnings .
the location for the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Stru@@ c@@ tured tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text while empty groups are such , in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in the inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; store component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied charging . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set up , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ and@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger @-@ Plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging needs . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally do not have to be taken care of . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is resum@@ ed . if this happens before a de@@ bug request started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include , it is corrected . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one , as if the current does not exist . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag Fol@@ ders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag file and the tool@@ bar . tag files contain two file types , the tag file and the tool@@ bar . tag tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster to insert into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D ; . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writer .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ .@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing more than nothing else than itself . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to launch window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ .@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ .@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; name &quot; &quot; status = &quot;
&quot; the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor , accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . with it , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New Action to create the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cuts assigned to this action . by clicking on the User @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the set settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the current document with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can be set to the default input . in the input field input , you can specify what to send to the default input . &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default error output are written . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Diagra@@ m other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered free , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; -@@ tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there is any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be split into several groups for a better view . open the tool bar to set dialog using the tool@@ bar . make sure the tool bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; knob is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by testing all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it is created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , check if someone has already done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language , then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = tag 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 3@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # vor Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the field of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to form the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts show the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply by using $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( like you have specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that this is good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you won &apos;t get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with enam@@ el , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the Di@@ alogue New Resource , you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , checks &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can start from the DT@@ D menu and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .

&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; there are some key concepts in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in order to understand this and gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bars about actions , everything that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing pane , the tree view , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the left mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card tra@@ cker , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , how to edit / paste / paste , edit the tag under the mouse po@@ inter , help the word under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , if the string under the mouse po@@ inter refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new features and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , eg . &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the symbol that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the overall view ( Q@@ IT ; ) enables you to navigate and navigate the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards , files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more on Tem@@ plates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the in@@ feed system , which is aligned to the content , allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the up @-@ to @-@ date document of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , should be qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what has already been developed by someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . through the program com@@ man@@ ders they can expand and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any script language syntax . ( more about it in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board , converts special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ inscription , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to add &amp; URL ; s to the anch@@ ors tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
search string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window , or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the location of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pres@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there , allowing for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have them assigned to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions . tool bars are saved via tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D are to be refresh@@ ed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags tag followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . click on an activated plu@@ gins disabled . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the type ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes may need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
establishes the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which add or modify the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free to license , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from the top to the bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ boun@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ org ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ like scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be integrated . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook , or by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu @-@ tree in the sub @-@ pane profile or using the Shift key ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore will be excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the Profile panel , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by atta@@ ching its own tree view to each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window team configuration , members of the project can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions can be switched on in the sub @-@ window event configuration and add , modify , or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the securing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , you open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that has been opened . you cannot currently influence this behavior . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project will open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can download different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile , the button will be removed to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option is not possible . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de , and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best stack@@ able using the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be renamed , tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be displayed , which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set Settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , such as the restrictions that one imag@@ ines for the file system . &quot;
some mit &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are usually stored in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be found in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the Tem@@ plate Tree . &quot;
these kinds of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base .
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate Save .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files tree view , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically combine with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link files with them . additionally , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described before ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in case of a regular folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot;
allows pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or he@@ aders for all templates for a specific project and allow for copying of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ er to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a contex@@ tual menu ( display right mouse button ) over a complete command link for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn it back to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , the key press will move the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL , editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... In the choice of V@@ PL ; View can be selected between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content such as keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the page in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , by moving with the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or remo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant , are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be tra@@ cked .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , need besides &amp; k@@ de ; still lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , it is checked for partial or complete agreement with a pre @-@ age named QNAP or a given mod@@ us@@ name . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; convert 20 times , if --@@ repeat two times is specified , the conversion will run 100 times &quot;

&quot; on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys to / from the commands previously executed . &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound words as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a stop point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template consisting only from the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .

&quot; there are many graphical tools for comparing , so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? ? let me briefly explain why I wrote . &quot;
&quot; the merging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merging . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , when merging the folder : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; opening Di@@ alogue enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; via the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the association or merging of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialogue you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the Pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the merge column of the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the button spr@@ int to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is simultaneously a conflict that must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears .
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind , and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; quotation conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing numbers or Ign@@ oring C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ figure upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , as you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart re@@ circulation + line feed \ \ r \ . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restore it to the next startup . ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides font with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press enter or return , the incoming line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . normally ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . while this option is checked , this option will be disabled . in default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow for very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Automati@@ cally advanced mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed on . &quot;
&quot; ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are covered in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g file . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; edit the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . with this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded hyper@@ link column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor exactly according to your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut bot@@ her@@ some parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is perfectly sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processing command for line distances to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
$ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3. but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example : &quot;
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the new@@ line Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merging and show the simulated changes without actually performing it
... performs selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will receive a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by folding the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about the problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical , if their entire contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green then becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes . &quot;

&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge selected ( unsure ) is checked , then investig@@ ates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and fails the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file is executed after the other . it displays the status column when merging successfully , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected for full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all combinations ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a destination , with the two @-@ folder merge B is chosen as the target and for synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries might be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge to start / continue in the -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cuts ) to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid merging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options Transpar@@ ency , Simulation and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes . then , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select the directory merge again / resume or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list you can see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged again . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set@@ ting Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous score marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; not on possible records . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare just the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of merging files will also be stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . you should check it in any case . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is renamed and maintains the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ or@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only merging whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the Fol@@ der merge view stays visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch to the window menu in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder merge . to do this , you can create a single file directly from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ .@@ Inclu@@ des . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( this is possible only with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files is from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select a C@@ utter 3@@ Part from the context menu . in addition , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all the program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , then these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the purpose of this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this has been too great so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot;
&quot; for a list of the last changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log , or Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package . &quot;
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the root folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ oval ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( behavior is probably altered in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the labels A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already available , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop environments as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to other applications .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the names of the virtual desktop will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as a small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty working areas will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here is the view of the program window selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , it shows how from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content and move . in addition , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic pack@@ ets . &quot;

&quot; you can read with &amp; K@@ mag ; a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the printed image or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded with new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may &amp; K@@ mag ; to create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ row at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; avoid that the cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ b ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
stopping or stopping the display stops . stopping the update will cause the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Cra@@ b &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fier , as if you are using a magni@@ fier to view the printed printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped . &quot;

&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ us@@ er@@ s.@@ s@@ f.@@ net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick prepares pain . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and can em@@ ulate pain on the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aid means , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Move is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it releases the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the application button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then get used to automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window , which does not constitute a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear quickly if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you use the smart move in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop , if you want a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely that you want to copy text , paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action where you can use the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble click of the mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , press the mouse button once the mouse po@@ inter res@@ umes . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a certain time that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text directory . from the text passages you can select often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; in the input field , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can choose between sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu , set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ Add page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding to pass the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text should be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of In @-@ In , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the input memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text pass@@ book @-@ book , you can determine if the text entry book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text directory will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ Add page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word supplement . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can merge the dic@@ tion@@ aries available . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth automatically inserts words entered into the dictionary , over time you create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text strings is bil@@ ingual . in the upper part the text passages are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the directory memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the directory memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correct or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the language edition command on the Spe@@ aking menu language edition . ( see Settings dialog for language synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and to spread it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread it without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ st and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
/ tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the voice generator &apos;s setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak text can be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can spend time again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer has to be installed on the computer .

&quot; select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can &amp; kt@@ ats ; almost to use . go back to the box General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ats ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language exam system from &amp; k@@ de ; start . click the General tab General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ats ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; if the field voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the Control Panel &apos;s Control Panel , it disappears again as soon as reading completes . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start , stop , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can pre @-@ read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages . &quot;
&quot; the map card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab General and tick the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text you want to read , and select the text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check the text you want to read , and then select the text you want to read in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system from &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about the events you have set . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message where your nick@@ name occurs in an IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu settings menu . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy here differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; it removes the tags b@@ r and b from messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you order from the map order is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the issue of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are executed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one such one reads , this output will stop and termin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced are delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined string replacement filters , which enable the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ at@@ ment of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set a female voice on the Spe@@ aker Card Spe@@ aker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following introduc@@ tory di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select this name arbitr@@ arily , it must be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column correspondence and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list of a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter will only apply if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to select a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must leave you om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you can only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular expressions can be found in the k@@ itting package . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such modifications . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it seeks a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program dict@@ ates , sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the speaker selection filter lets you over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s a value entered , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialogue of speakers . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your Spe@@ aker Settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ary Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the language synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ats ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code , such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you will be given .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the above @-@ mentioned languages supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; de@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only chew@@ ed f@@ lange is output . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend it for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to &amp; kt@@ ats ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you download the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ DLL , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball that has been created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; first , make sure speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; , which uses the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can res@@ ign , repeat or cancel phrases or paragra@@ phs . &quot;
&quot; if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen automatically . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ats , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Add @-@ on tab , and insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the box office speaker is displayed . for example , the set up of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in voices that are &amp; kt@@ ats ; known , this setting is automatically done . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , using Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliding controls you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regulator and display this grey , the voice selected by you will not allow you to adjust these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting the K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click Apply to click Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is frac@@ t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can skip or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed here . screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types from &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ats ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , you can &apos;t load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ ,@@ 50 % is equivalent to half and 200@@ mm ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Def@@ ault .
&quot; on this card card , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pronoun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just have a long text read on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ats ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Al@@ erts . the tab notification appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de , messages . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and dict@@ ated ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio position in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can &amp; kt@@ ats ; faster with the reading process , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the Stat@@ utory Identi@@ fication Fil@@ ters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add other Constitu@@ tions filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn is how to set the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection . switch off the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection and select text to read . switch the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection again , change some features and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ating and add a tab ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set boundaries ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de , messages , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal sentence detection filter from default , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in it . &quot;
&quot; on the card card Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection , you can over@@ write the Spe@@ aker Settings for the Application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card reader ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker that has all the features of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , ts &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ats ; the speaker , which is most likely to correspond to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may wish to specify the attribute language lies ahead when you know that a specific application sends text in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default spokes@@ man and then use the speaker that matches the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it &apos;s started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability . &quot;
you may need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; there is a problem on your system that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / cap@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / cap@@ tiv@@ al@@ int file , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ded modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card card for Inter@@ active . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ml converter filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t make it happen that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that Festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added my own string er@@ ector filter and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ats ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the track record orders are shown , the order consists of only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;

before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; please check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . for help , please refer to the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software to the Festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to vote for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from &quot;
keep in mind that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language balance system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon Files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be created from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf to display the device at all and allow the setting of the network features .
&quot; in most cases , drivers are installed for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and configured . if network devices are later added , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the Option network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this one tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the non @-@ return questions , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , click the button system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
&quot; the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button shows the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are picked up by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are performed for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setup is required . &quot;
&quot; with the option &quot; &quot; Manual &quot; &quot; you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Beh@@ ind or Her@@ mit in the priority list . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group Calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... the dialog will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list Nam@@ ingly well @-@ known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains a number of entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known host has multiple ali@@ ases names , press de button multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog of your computer will be displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm pack@@ ets ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file are discussed ; changing configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focused on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point , which runs a valid IP address or , if available , can be used by D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore its arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections another content is defined as set there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; if you choose fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change users &apos; schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ juven@@ ate the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot find it , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the Status Bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ection of the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; gives by a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been resolved , and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape must be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format it from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives are not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat continues ; with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be monitored . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the View menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up Settings for Backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can start restoring , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog displays settings for recovery . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput , and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; in this way , a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current work folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be monitored will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are stored , such as the folder . folders that lie on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ ited &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection to the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this string is computer name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access , for example , to information about issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some advanced features , with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which help can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log . if it is not displayed , and instead of it a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log folder , for normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or by entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only protocol lines will be displayed , which are included for the selected filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the log file ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the startup of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can turn the option to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to allow all new lines to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web@@ page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; - Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start when the system is running in the &amp; Linux ; world . and because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go further on historical aspects here ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first in / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
&quot; the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you want to change the in@@ it@@ tab . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts manually from the command line on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is inv@@ oked with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is easy to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with In@@ sert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ter number or name of an entry manually , press the button to change the properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for running under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
&quot; if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check , if all configuration files are present , which are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without a message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly furnished . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only shown if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space constraints ( quota ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . more card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix . &quot;
the card reader password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
&quot; this map appears only if space restriction ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least a lost file system ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are given in KB : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system , with space limitation &quot;
&quot; the card groups are informed about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ aries section . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and change the boot password , add the time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
