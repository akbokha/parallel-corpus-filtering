<seg id="149">"if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't use & digiplug;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees a very fast search and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide if other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc."</seg>
<seg id="151">"you might be happy with this structure. holiday images can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you are making enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page."</seg>

<seg id="190">"the most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy heat absorbs and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices."</seg>
<seg id="192">"as an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shocks that also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for laptops and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a break-free power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"in addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting."</seg>

<seg id="203">"the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until one day open a photo and this was destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year."</seg>
<seg id="206">"ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English."</seg>

<seg id="219">"there is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for a data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day."</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system with the exception that it is only sampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">"let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and store it to a new disk:"</seg>

<seg id="236">"open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year."</seg>
<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the needs of the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon even at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers drag it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>

<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned into the settings due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a penetrating white. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as they show the top lights in various roses. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as quickly as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the Recstrut option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually."</seg>

<seg id="309">"a demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data generated by the color filtered image sensor, which many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour structure."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanners have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are the same from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the subject comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to link your monitor, since sRGB is running the circle. if you are working as the color space of sRGB, you must either link your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Adjustment and Contrast extend from the Correct Automatic correction menu automatically attempt to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what best works with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the thicknesses across the picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"comparisons: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the maximum range and a redesign of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be customized in size. on the left side, you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram is shown on the top right, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance that you set, you can now store it into a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as used for processing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to find tonvalue correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use it for several photos. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner is always the same error and you always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partially developed print was replaced by the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. finally, a further increase creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and this process (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition by & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchstarch / Contrast / Gamma, the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog on this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to postpone the control and look at how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. images of a digital camera often contain the linear histogram of a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates grainy images especially in dark areas."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look sharper. in fact, it does not improve a bit, it works rather psychically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpness filter already during reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be viewed with the menu entry Corrective sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful with this, as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also intensifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image is refocusing the tool. you can get further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracking. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the soft sign and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radio shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiper image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocusing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocusing results usually achieve better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche folding. the Gauß'sche folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß 'fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value 1 should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is gossip. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by sharpening the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpcorrection in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this checks the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD hiss, a high value will generate wavy-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally it is enough 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular gradient da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more the quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to leave it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be corrected with this in a text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a strange black artefact in the background that caused by a bad movie deposit during the journey.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-window details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius monitors the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can wipe the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter will no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can not remove the whole noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the image settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. when it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft sign and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß'sche noise, film granulas, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture replacement is performed using a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artifacts & quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction will be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grading on the faces. the original image is below (1) and this corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">"below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph caused by a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scannerlight and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="553">The Hotpixel tool allows Hotpixel to remove photos using a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button DarkImage. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and loads it automatically in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">"select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then, select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:"</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure area of today's film and the color or grey depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that has been made without this filter."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or random a light intensity of 2."</seg>
<seg id="572">"adjusting the image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls provide only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; picture editing from the color gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of the fourth grade corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually."</seg>
<seg id="580">"generally speaking, this value controls the strength of the second degree of distortion. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner parameter' has the reverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resscaled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog displays the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction afterwards, the effect would be apparent to the falsehood."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to see the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformers cutting from image editing or using the zoom control of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motives, e.g. shots of front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture."</seg>
<seg id="592">"below the preview, you can set two parameters to adjust film granulatory and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add Film Few if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film granulatory and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows will know how snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"as the filter paints color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digikam; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grading on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers are mixing large silver grains of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two regulators to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the lines, which define the outline in the drawing, are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower one adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">"zoom blurr: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera, creating a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography."</seg>

<seg id="617">Rangeance: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">"Schüttelersharpenfe: blurring the picture through random shifting of the pixels, thus simulating the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera."</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size doesn't grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can stop with the & digicam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes good work here. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformers size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is checked, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons" "Save as and Load" "are used exactly to do this. enlarge each insertion for photo can be stored as a text file and then reloaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>

<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to crop a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle, you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"if you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be edged by drawing at the corners of the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Add button of Image Processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool According to page ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait mode, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool According to page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool According to page ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the translation help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third gel, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it dives in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden spiral above. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not identical triangles. diagonals on these lines can make a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options and mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">"rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are set in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right."</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular openings in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically crop function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get immense triangular openings at the corners. a way to clean it is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side. a horizontal shear, for example, turns the top part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area."</seg>
<seg id="680">"for your help, a vertical and horizontal line will be displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have completed the scaling, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two notes are twice as much blurring and so you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the scaling, the image has ugly triangular openings in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & edited."</seg>

<seg id="860">"if you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described more accurately."</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. by doing so, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all your HTML files, select a root folder and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file. the advantage of all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and this file can be shared so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can either export a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>

<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for the export of images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important feature of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit the size of the image. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send them in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Import..., you will be able to import the exported database as described in it."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import pictures should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database people. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window to import the categories of the imported file and what categories they correspond to in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to search and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive; recursively because each pixel is always separated and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam per pixel. if the difference between the colour values to the neighbouring pixels is exceeded, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Group of abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are separately pursued and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on jittering, & Povray; the beams um a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex pieces of music and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good pleasure for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without considering the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoder program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of programming settings for encoders and these parameters here. the manual or help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -t {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs, upload the information instead of entering the machine itself. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only be known by the programmer who checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reader program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to store in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; please note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read-out WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real on it and whether cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"you must have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. a suitable package for lame can be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine since it is considered non-free software."</seg>

<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change it at any time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the word drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the same drum (as some of the keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussion channel. look at the included keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for that channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, you will always use patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio exists in which ratio of pitch Bender events will be multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard, which is a pitch-bender event, should play a tone higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see what sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can select an instrument."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the Channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; s home)"</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus, available. from toolbars about actions, everything that is marked globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus, is stored. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing pane, the tree view, the boxes with information and the toolbars. please check in and for more information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the left mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card tracker, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, how to edit / paste / paste, edit the tag under the mouse pointer, help the word under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string under the mouse pointer refers to a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new features and related user requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, eg. & lt; insert into your document, then click the symbol that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus, the working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more on Templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>

<seg id="2281">"there are many graphical tools for comparing, so why & kdiff3?? let me briefly explain why I wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">"& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3, when merging the folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening Dialogue enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the association or merging of folders will be introduced. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialogue you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three spring windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, one can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (with C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the Preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the merge column of the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is deactivated!!! (use the button sprint to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparators are used, each difference is simultaneously a conflict that must be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind, and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insertion button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-figure upward / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the mark to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, as you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>

<seg id="2335">"(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec.

<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded hyperlink column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file.

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor exactly according to your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut bothersome parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command has been specified (see above), the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is perfectly sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line distances to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '.</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line spacing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">"sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then, you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER' However perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal Preprocessor, the newline Preprocessor sees the output of the normal Preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system stores the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information on issues that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence attempts to provide some advanced features, with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which help can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup, & ksystemlog, first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log. if it is not displayed, and instead of it a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log folder, for normal users usually do not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or by entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only protocol lines will be displayed, which are included for the selected filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the log file; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the startup of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can turn the option to new lines in the main window's context menu to allow all new lines to be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own webpage on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; - Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start when the system is running in the & Linux; world. and because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I will not go further on historical aspects here (among others, because I don't know about it myself: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first in / etc after an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial only once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial port in / etc / rc.d."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"the default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you want to change the inittab."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts manually from the command line on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is invoked with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time device is easy to fail to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorter number or name of an entry manually, press the button to change the properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for running under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using SuSE; or Delx (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution: please check, if all configuration files are present, which are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly furnished."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>

<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only shown if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. more card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix."</seg>
