&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American writers and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist chi@@ ef@@ ly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; freely to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
&quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sch@@ wär@@ mer love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; with his mind , he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he tells us exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and agreed in notes for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won with the Repub@@ lican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s world@@ view did not coinci@@ de with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ ump@@ et In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love towards America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are aware of , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; but you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( M. B. Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebellion against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; stem@@ ming from white in allu@@ ding to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ di@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country , as its President , elected twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the White America gives this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city which is popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and anti @-@ violence . &quot;
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope for the youth .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to keep track of their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day Tr@@ ump@@ et , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Cha@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
that changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; each year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before seeking the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were upset and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this type on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior citizen of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which perme@@ ates criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , which is why it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trace@@ ability to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in prohibited areas , such as those who point out that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also if they were a criminal . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what does this mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially viable . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues , which lose the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include actions like sailing under false flag , fake documents , imag@@ inations , species of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You can &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i tries to close now . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the closed front has been working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found flying ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of any track@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; getting together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
&quot; ships , which previously had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had any consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile registered a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats have bought more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ nets whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia has announced its first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship on its way without licence and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the conduct of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the global ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot; &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , gathered in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rein@@ statement of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ lands area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up the context of the government decision in her latest article : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on ten@@ ure for many is considered the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country@@ wide Civil War and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most common pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an cries out . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about conflicts , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the central @-@ north of the town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the amount of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an office procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the road !
&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from their point of view , made little difference against the devastating economic crisis , and rather occupied themselves with critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified in the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano didn &apos;t choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department in La Per@@ la in 1976 until 1978 . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ us &apos;s son , a man who , over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve been friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
don &apos;t worry that they don &apos;t guide you one day and then I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that it would be fine , because so my father had raised me up . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; over there , the prisoners are tortured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
all of this was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in , and saw a couch being tortured on men . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person tied up there .
&quot; they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a cargo of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that someone else can do so much suffering ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck and killed a man there .
&quot; according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the path you came in here is also the way , where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here . &quot;
&quot; when looking at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that the boot@@ y of war is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military strikes , which one has fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; You , who are driving cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to tell .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were executed during the dictatorship of people , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave behind ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I repeatedly asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last horrible act man can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and disposed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course there is always something left .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I even myself was with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; that they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Well , let me know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I issued the first ad . &quot;
finally I realized he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have ended up against my own father .
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest pending the end of the trial . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , in 28 cases sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder ; torture and rape by officials .
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and taken to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ humane minds .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research therefore lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial site which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driver &apos;s license , last month witnessed a very successful translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign the Japanese word , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but also with vi@@ cious rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 , was translated as &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ist &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; processing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was caused by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the fla@@ wed English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct nam@@ ing &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture have ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported on the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are still concerned . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter , named un@@ named , brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently turn against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the paper on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How is the translation corrupt , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their mother tongue , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have a foreign employee , however , do not allow translations to be made in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered to be the best , is made to a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the verb@@ ati@@ m and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , created by machine translation , show that this technique will not be able to replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : take protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also recorded recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was caught , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ ura : enable your VPN .
it seems that Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have once again been locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I have signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO , VE@@ IT , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond in@@ correctly or deny the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests live in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a brief report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what happened . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money handed over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , and especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated against the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who has her daughter in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; passes to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent strikes . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra struck a pole on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in social media .
&quot; more cows than children are registered in Paraguay , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be pointing out - if for the first time in the story of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all , and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she still remained time to learn .
she got up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house@@ wife &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she paid for everything she received from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not a group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
starting on Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven year old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very nice , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , it was written by &quot; a girl from the homeland that wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad cli@@ cked once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the history of Paraguay ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the wives of the Guar@@ an@@ í , and the system of the cant@@ een ( in which the workers were subjected to tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register at the government

sixty Egyptian parliament votes recently voted in favour of a bill on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register with a government agency in Egypt in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the Act , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the draft bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice , video ads and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users . it is not clear how they should make up for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; leading research scientist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that no other nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the Kurdist@@ an Mountains in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , spread through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on the fact that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a major pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , while 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of shel@@ ters from shel@@ ters is still trying to res@@ ett@@ le into definitive replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ tered shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such hous@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated homes were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident attracted widespread interest in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has re@@ gained extensively , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma goes back far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist arri@@ vals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 displaced people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 there were over 23@@ ,000 people res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , most of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ations , still dwelling in homes , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love for music has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being hit by police across national demonstrations

on the right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . across the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; doctors operated it on this Saturday , and now put it into an artificial coma . &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a ra@@ p . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás have known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the examination of the incident by the active service . &quot;
the pictures show police officers how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire oppression would therefore be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs come to him shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was in charge of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him with a ra@@ ke . &quot;
police ass@@ aults
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; police officers deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers . &quot;
&quot; Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reject violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media has sli@@ d street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their photo pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
&quot; this must also be recognized , if one is strictly against any form of material damage . &quot;
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane plants have been paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the production , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve him of his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long period of in@@ active time because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembered that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a new one . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially recorded documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for employment and services generated by the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during Mam@@ mot@@ h &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane plants
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to im@@ itate them , they also stopped trying to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , it also dis@@ advant@@ aged other firms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek out other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at age 65 , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop begins with the idea that the young participants will discuss themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever happens to them . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway der tears , &quot; a section in West Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and as well as our youth move forward
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the verse in sil@@ verb@@ s ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
plastic dishes ( up to you ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new mobile strips decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , a popular rice bowl with seafood was turned into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ated is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , in order for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ dies ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , for you , to the tag # &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid of life &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to go and to graves , to the people whom we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known illness and sensation journ@@ alism for a number of years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; people &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village can be justified by the fact that they were &quot; recep@@ tive . &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was sack@@ ed by threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals burst money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn how to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life is made of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was only a couple of blocks from his home who saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Ci@@ tiz@@ ens for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and pages linked to , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fac@@ tual check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
tra@@ gically the tank car fell victim to the victim .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people who looked at the football world championship . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been revi@@ ved several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a man on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were fragmented , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt by the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ appropri@@ ations ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; even one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely explain the picture taken from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the image taken from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news agencies , called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but they did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false alle@@ gations extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search using the Tin@@ Eye search@@ engine has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3rd , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the image taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have identified examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they had been published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked together ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely detected ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the picture taken from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false messages . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples of the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture taken from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

one side of the rum@@ ors was that the said photograph shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City also addresses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria Est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in northern Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
&quot; as its source , La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Twitter posts after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , who used the picture taken from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate is silent . &quot;
&quot; this article draws attention to the continuing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article by the Indian Express with the picture taken from the DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express did not contain this picture at the time of the publication of our contribution . &quot;

this page used the picture as proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fac@@ tual check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a German Association of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
a resident of the Old Town district P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo was a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ gi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used impro@@ per@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a correction of what they used to be &quot; deliber@@ ate news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this rec@@ tification , which appeared exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ours that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ itting arter@@ ios@@ clerosis &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT showing Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news @-@ page wrong@@ ly asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar had admitted Th@@ ein 2012 in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , bringing the story together with the picture of S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 and , at the time of this publication , the picture is still included . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , supposedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to ho@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; from the message contained in the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos distance themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture might ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . it is therefore worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently have a share of drinking water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy is to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and spectators and they have the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from context or completely mis@@ used way . &quot;
&quot; however , every examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into consideration how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is licensed according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ por@@ te@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pra@@ y your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; the speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka eng@@ ages with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally begins at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud waves . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ding wor@@ sens the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was standing in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations , and further five are ready to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants of their flooded villages . &quot;
various organisations and start @-@ ups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March 21st January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in my four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth to me her children : she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we are still calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we are making rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , tied from an American flag , others gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that has established itself in their imagination . &quot;
you have to get rid of me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
to be reli@@ eved
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; that &apos;s what happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ i Jal@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims , while Western books have been col@@ oni@@ zed for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still pers@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate for 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans who had been hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children become anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell , and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh called Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoid@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the pick@@ pockets with us . &quot;
&quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ trained Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who breaks down a woman &apos;s scar@@ f . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran , which are called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi centuries ago .

being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which established a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying . &quot;

&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy takes place in the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a c@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branches of &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ys that started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that closes its borders against people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely catches the sight of Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we reject in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed participants a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the slightest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we have in our news au@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many ways . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they have mastered large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as I was now my daughter , but who today made me a Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , there may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public image , four decades ago , even scientific of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to question ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president who is already bombar@@ ded with broken countries and &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
narrative art initiative aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages can not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are , to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often is linked to understanding &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to feel , feel , touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers start their story in their own language first and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even though the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and their presentation lead to the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the Fa@@ ble of Rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for res@@ ett@@ lement of sovereign debt from the United States
&quot; on April 3 , 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on April 3 , 2017 , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ sting of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the res@@ ignation of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts will be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to deal with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , suggests a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture held in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ P@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available for roy@@ alty free , contains a series of es@@ says dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it says : &quot;
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what are the real costs associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on the side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice who wants to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in jail for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that they were contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Siegel , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles blend with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in place , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria , but of the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not complete this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ se book , which she wrote in 2012 @-@ 2015 to her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It &apos;s happening . &quot;
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I went into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el :
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
during the rest of the year
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : director sentenced to release due to corruption
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger at a corruption case , where a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants on account of in@@ tre@@ sting 54 million Me@@ ti@@ als ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the Mozambique airports , the Cam@@ ba@@ za Council between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ press to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to resume its director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and demonstrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary .
&quot; the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been reduced . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious that Cam@@ ba@@ za is willingly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t have any moral ethics : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the State because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served in the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mozambique Channel , but also as a sharp , conc@@ ise and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , including the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he &apos;s not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison .
&quot; and today the company , in which he dis@@ mis@@ ses money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ β © Ra@@ fik , 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or Sp@@ ind@@ b@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ke@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it del@@ etes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what it should instead do is carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next door .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ inters ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who are spreading hate speech , receive quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to en@@ vy their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven that keywords of keywords are often a cat and mouse game , using social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author gave his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied messages . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language but were still removed : &quot;
used with approval .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the region of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
for his failure Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concluded with the pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group called representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , at age , does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , was 2.8 percent , and at 18 , it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 of 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to abol@@ ish the laws of children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without a doubt , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ensured tension in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but in early 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again : &quot;
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one voted against it . &quot;
&quot; after he had previously been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic , because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s marriage . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial commission in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the kid@@ nap@@ pers are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; fo@@ lic Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft to am@@ end the marriage was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all the de@@ pu@@ ties who were present have voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted by law . &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing ag@@ ei@@ ling@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al Ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users would wish to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; rather , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem , we would say that the state , our daughters against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judi@@ ci@@ ary action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children in different gra@@ dations are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;
H@@ acker cranes the office of the prosec@@ utor against national protests on the Russian national holiday

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the side - but in the cache it remained intact . &quot;
it &apos;s # spar@@ ed
&quot; on Sunday morning , the office of the prosec@@ utor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia &apos;s content &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , opposing the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ure . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ experienced Internet users are used to using circum@@ navigation tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the world &apos;s most famous country when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now sub@@ merged . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , in spite of the legal ban , available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in mind to lay snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed fashion . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mis@@ er@@ ors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a retreat from N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I was at home , when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the river Rap@@ ti . &quot;
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood face to face with Tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately sets out , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
in order to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take photos of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by an Appe@@ al Court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is widespread among men . however , they have far less rights to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he , in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , stepped into a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ p has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom which they all maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call it on his name from now on . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word Patri@@ arch@@ ate before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ inted from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women should never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she only ki@@ cked in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole an@@ thro@@ ated fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the rush of adren@@ aline , having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
&quot; he laugh@@ ed , and I stopped carrying him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not ceased altogether , but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to take care of who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say something loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ty cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) in a discussion so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will manage it . &quot;
Roh@@ ini confirms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed :
so far we have done only small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a couple of times , but stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les Memorial Day &quot; &quot; was found in the jap@@ an@@ ese t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 applies as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit in 2016 : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka said , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today , the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely have to visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; the Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is celebrated .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base in terms of marketing , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen @-@ no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day will be lost today .
&quot; so , we hope you are here ! &quot;

male @-@ headed men are taken ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warn the population that gl@@ atz@@ faced men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique , is worried about a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for the organ trade , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , and the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man at Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia at the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on male @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to examine this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; respect for bald men , who travel to Mozambique , target ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dis@@ believing rituals , has commissioned cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also allu@@ des to the fact that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , who generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the major social difficulty confron@@ ting Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , DAS S@@ ICH ashamed a country in which people would have shame to pursue sex against good scores , work and other achievements , a nation in which men would not hurt honest employment or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which men would not be able to get rid of good scores , or even take their lives to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some did not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald . &quot;
Muslim authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ der@@ ous people of the country .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt sympathy towards his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
&quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we have the honour to make Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the start of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions were suspended . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to remove Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits that they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad expressed that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he assi@@ sts him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical provision of its choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany and Germany
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Peking of the Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had big concerns about whether the fuss around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s foreign ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds in an Declaration on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments that he , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will ultimately receive it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; the Council of mainland China in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supports Singapore as a city .
no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who are preten@@ ding to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , because it is better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he tar@@ red the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls upon Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it correctly associates and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who do our prime minister have to pay back invoices ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine expands to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I replied . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook internally before anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be pi@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( who has one &apos;s Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really was a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ king Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ king the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and in spite of their promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend does .
&quot; although not specifically political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and got 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; amend@@ ment &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict but@@ t against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
&quot; one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in east @-@ east Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ sic war has been officially terminated , but its s@@ cars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern suburbs in T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; more than 10,000 people lived here during the pre @-@ war period , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ ly cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
&quot; the buildings are deca@@ yed , and they are rarely inhabited by more than two families . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ ading splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district in the meantime .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which have one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where the laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ach@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get through the rounds .
&quot; in the winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her home for a while .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and they all lived as they were right .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation tends to end , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now ch@@ asing the ball .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is head of a small hotel in Tap@@ ak@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way to migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ene frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 nights sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept on boxes outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has recently arrived . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gurt mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he says smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the town , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his office . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ e@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers always consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ ma she fli@@ cks in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she briefly imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang , by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi , received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities continue to use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in distant , afflicted ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often organize extreme cens@@ orship and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; ( the &quot; &quot; show@@ y &quot; &quot; ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ eman checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions given by the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; to be registered at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything important van@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot;
a woman who gives her name to all glory .
one that has settled down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality re@@ covers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams for death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of the unknown . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn away during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to crush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been st@@ owed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice ech@@ o@@ ing through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious picture full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the slightest . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have sh@@ ook it all the way to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me hear you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot;
his eyes filled with hat@@ eful eyes .
and you &apos;re really sad about looking at me and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , along with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed set is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I take all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably assigned me a bigger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the cler@@ k left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell gen@@ ome was a &quot; self @-@ service . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking fac@@ ades can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( like &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13 . S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of vision of their world view . &quot;
here is no home that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I enter the interro@@ gation room and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de on him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life as you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and strokes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this penalty . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er suddenly rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe with a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them switched off , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he picked up an electric rod next to him . &quot;
&quot; electricity went through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electric conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fearful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always let me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch . &quot;
but what you can leave is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has been heard since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the lu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ens of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual inc@@ ens@@ er Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the deputy and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who continued to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an ever @-@ clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender norms by depri@@ ving his vision of the fate of Arab women who mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently settled woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of countless women , who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside left . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be deta@@ ined in@@ definitely in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is very popular , and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been fed me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; it was uploaded to You@@ tube without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not renoun@@ ce Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ de , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ de , who was to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did not do anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they have critically commented on the problems caused by the deep @-@ rooted corruption in social media . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kind of induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; as far as this is concerned , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the trucks , drums and dancing were handed over for over a thousand years and from a time that armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous population of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ lor@@ ries are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter high @-@ end car was incredible .

young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ bee &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dres@@ sers and to receive training in the hair@@ dresser , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letters of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it even more important , people who feel em@@ powered to receive affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , who encouraged young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to a rhet@@ oric of war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare , must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must unite and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate who took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more need . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to deliver letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ant led me through the camp of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ row@@ er , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life has someone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly tears came to me about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined by a discussion group . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as early as war , and the F@@ ARC had already been in hiding . &quot;
&quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; one of them is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people , even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former comb@@ at@@ ants responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hangs over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not only made overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; in the end , she moved to the USA out of fear for her life . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Ch@@ echn@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , do you care ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything together and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that all was just bad speech , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car was standing under the window with dark@@ ened windows and a plate plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I &apos;m actually trying to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who are dor@@ t@@ t ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men deta@@ ined in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Gaddafi &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are deta@@ ined there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports to date . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings from people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 , I was already known all over Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I had never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even cur@@ bed a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children if they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold on ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
&quot; he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you have to go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for that .
I discovered these people myself when I ab@@ used them .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet it exists - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transi@@ ll@@ ables to men who love males , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had lit himself .
some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families , and to follow a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian provinces , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are seeking employment , completed primary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone oral speech or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances surrounding the Arab ancest@@ or , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treat@@ able depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why do I not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still passes through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is well known and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin colour , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to both gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in historical regard a degra@@ ded and marg@@ inal@@ ised being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement total silence , no matter how many black women try to teach them of better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move us into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming itself ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can re@@ conquer ourselves ) states that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled repeatedly over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to his community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on neglected , poorly attended sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own ways . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; from cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also did not use the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women refund an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reported to the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 hits and statistics 2 Un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ ations and a legal system , which is nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a research institute in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney General . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace courses . 86 % of women &apos;s adver@@ ts came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who don &apos;t do that , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since there is no separate crime in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , a woman died every ten days in Paraguay because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should not be regre@@ t@@ ted forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I first read about it , I always thought that this happens only to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told us how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked to please him for so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not native to Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with mental abuse . &quot;
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; the authorities stayed with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ sten ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain fem@@ ini@@ ties into an independent criminal act and to punish tough@@ er as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the law text has been modified in some respects to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that advoc@@ ated the fact that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original draft of the bill was intended to cover most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves , if they just want to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure housing , to raise the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get away . &quot;
we have to report for such a long time until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed before , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section about reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; is read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served as a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the sole sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , restric@@ ting public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and to incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , established an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of justice &quot; published in the paper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in a law@@ suit . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , was charged from the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was forbidden on any road , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for the distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of each 3000 denom@@ inated ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; a b@@ ail was issued for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released from the central prison in Mas@@ kat on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served as a prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Justice to close the Az@@ am@@ n paper .
&quot; despite the court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to face attacks by the Japanese government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further directive , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman .
&quot; further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Japanese authorities :
1 . let You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the paper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical needs on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : right now the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bi@@ b national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently star@@ ing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
&quot; GM : in your opinion , what are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a mo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and chances of development are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and the internet . &quot;
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what &apos;s the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines can only be made accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many salads he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green colour or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cereals or car@@ rots . because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned with the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but he has no need for it since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river in order to p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ dish sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ dish variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow them - two aspects that are forbidden and / or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ enced professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , peasants &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the open @-@ source movement does not concern GM crops .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds with free access to their seeds , as opposed to patent seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it either not at all difficult or difficult to use for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat have been patented in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases with more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ able . &quot;
Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property encourages other breeders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees this : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is made impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is bot@@ her@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves , and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the U.S. state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them . &quot;
&quot; anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation is needed massive her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative due to the avoid@@ ance of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks as if I was trying to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected 20 years before competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the US seems to be the leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is an open source seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for breeding are different from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; one explanation , however , is not a law ; now it is at the Govern@@ ments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for which the official start of the start should fall for the planned next year . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who defend the law , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles he writes for Egypt &apos;s non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even though the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is nevertheless for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , a charge at the national Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave ones go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also , af@@ te documented the blocking of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access .
&quot; the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to trial against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day after day newspapers in all Brazil report glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rau@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ way to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the threshold of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the editorial &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; It is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to hide the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; hurt more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country , according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per State , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also result in serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police came up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to revenge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack on chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which resulted in inhabitants being transported locally or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled food . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that there is now more and more recognition . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels made of plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started producing &quot; &quot; fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a stat@@ es@@ man .
&quot; fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ works spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos alone , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the county of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread out on the net and show images that allow for better insight into the events :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages have been evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val goes on in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens sought information or attempted to contact members , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civilian safety data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and , at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers stopped the attack of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , was part of the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she couldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes : the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum -@@ which can still go for months after the application of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ anded li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including cutting shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the history of their trip to Italy , through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; this way they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt facilitate shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament checks a bill which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
&quot; users must register to use social networks , within six months following the successful decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . under the legislative proposal , however , such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until May 20 , as the prison management of human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of including weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ ar@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists to document backed @-@ up documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ ses a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ in website , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans look for the support of the bill . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the event . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their identity document ?
&quot; according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing news in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have proposed to sel@@ ectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
&quot; then , do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the state government as the &quot; organizer of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that allow the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ stand@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave that the site had been closed because it was &quot; an information source working with groups to send a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing down
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
