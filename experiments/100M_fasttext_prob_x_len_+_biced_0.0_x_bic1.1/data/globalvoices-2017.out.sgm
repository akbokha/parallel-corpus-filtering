<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American writers and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist chiefly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"freely to Method Man," I was it as if that was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very schwärmer love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his mind, he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells us exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and agreed in notes for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumpet's worldview did not coincide with the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumpet Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love towards America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are aware of, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"but you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(M. B. Ü): as much as" "rebellion against all other ethnicities" "; stemming from white in alluding to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country, as its President, elected twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the White America gives this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">Do Latinos have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now trumps country, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and anti-violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare glimmer of hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to keep track of their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day Trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguay and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"each year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberian waters before seeking the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything", "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior citizen of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which permeates criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, which is why it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in prohibited areas, such as those who point out that a ship charges his caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also if they were a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what does this mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially viable."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like sailing under false flag, fake documents, imaginations, species of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could then say" You can't run my port. ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me. "" and just this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close now. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front has been working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found flying ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authorities for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organisation: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of any trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" getting together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense, "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project, where a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which previously had been fished without a license and hardly had any consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile registered a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats have bought more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board townets whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty, the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia has announced its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship on its way without licence and were used trawl nets which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia." "with the conduct of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the global ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in, and saw a couch being tortured on men."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a cargo of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was terrible... like a filthy wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that someone else can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people chewed quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla Ribera process, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>

<seg id="262">"the path you came in here is also the way, where the abductions came here."</seg>
<seg id="263">"when looking at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal and I replied," "You, who are driving cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes to home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me a burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway I was there to tell.</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, you were executed during the dictatorship of people, but what the corpses leave behind?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>

<seg id="299">"I repeatedly asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last horrible act man can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="344">"the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto, in which one can extend its driver's license."</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing of the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driver's license, last month witnessed a very successful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"in a sign the Japanese word, which means" older drivers, "wrongly - but also with vicious rear-thoughts & # 8212, was translated as" "terrible motorist". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">"from 1 to 20 September, the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself."</seg>
<seg id="350">"processing of the original photo by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was caused by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-published daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the flawed English translation was first removed. the designation" "dangerous drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct naming" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture have apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported on the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are still concerned."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"as a result, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the reporter, named unnamed, brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently turn against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the paper on the translation error, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"is this (" "terrible driver" ") not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "How is the translation corrupt, isn't it?" ""</seg>
<seg id="370">"-" "I don't think that is a real translation error."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their mother tongue, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have a foreign employee, however, do not allow translations to be made in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered to be the best, is made to a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the verbatim and enigmatic sentences, created by machine translation, show that this technique will not be able to replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen "(" Flying cows, falling schools "), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she said," "That's what happened." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money handed over their underage son or their underage daughter to another more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society, and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas, and especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated against the Criaditas guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who has her daughter in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and" make something out of herself, "passes to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will only learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent strikes. shortly thereafter she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck a pole on Marín until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">"organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of the Criadazgo, rooted in the paraguayan society, responsible for the death of the girl."</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest and called for "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely spread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows than children are registered in Paraguay," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl, who was their Criadita."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be pointing out - if for the first time in the story of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo is coming to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour force; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work all, and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up at five o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." "I was allowed to pick up more books from the housewife's library as food from the fridge," "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliament votes recently voted in favour of a bill on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is adopted by the Parliament, users must register with a government agency in Egypt in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the Act, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the draft bill consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice, video ads and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users. it is not clear how they should make up for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "leading research scientist" ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights" "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislature and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft" stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and that no other narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of" "threatening public order" "and" "to protest". ""</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the Kurdistan Mountains in the northeast of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, spread through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on the fact that a large predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza is passionately showing a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">She has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" "triple disaster" "in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a major prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, Fukushima Prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, while 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of shelters from shelters is still trying to resettle into definitive replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in sheltered shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such housings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuated evacuated homes were resettled into final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools that were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures, the tsunami and the nuclear accident attracted widespread interest in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has regained extensively, but Fukushima goes back far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist arrivals in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 displaced people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016 there were over 23,000 people resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40,000 residents of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophes, most of the evacuated evacuations, still dwelling in homes, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane plants have been paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the production, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long period of inactive time because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembered that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a new one."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality looked even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound according to the 2016 report" Agricultural perspectives "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>

<seg id="654">"in the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" fraud. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"these were officially recorded documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent."</seg>
<seg id="664">"Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters." the country had no money for the sugar cane factories, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>
<seg id="666">"he was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped."</seg>

<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives for employment and services generated by the communities in which they were located."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know whether during Mammoth's speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the persons present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well."</seg>

<seg id="675">"when the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to imitate them, they also stopped trying to asphalve the road, it also disadvantaged other firms."</seg>
<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to seek out other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">"without prospects for the future, many young people also left the region."</seg>
<seg id="679">"in the area, a food factory was created whose production does not even serve to supply the community."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it with hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop begins with the idea that the young participants will discuss themes such as" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self acceptance, "or whatever happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway der tears, "a section in West Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way they can grow and as well as our youth move forward</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "plastic models of the dishes" ") of each dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"in Naver matome, the Blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new mobile strips decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, a popular rice bowl with seafood was turned into a mobile phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">Here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon-cheated is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, in order for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also paddies (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco. ""</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid of life") tells us exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday, we are again preparing ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to go and to graves, to the people whom we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">He left the house on 13 October.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is also here with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't get paid off because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensation journalism for a number of years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"people's innocence is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village can be justified by the fact that they were" receptive. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family was sacked by threats." it describes how armed criminals burst money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I must learn how to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life is made of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he was only a couple of blocks from his home who saw the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed with organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Citizens for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this wrong coupling of picture and event -" wrong description "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tank truck traversed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths of potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people who looked at the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "That's Nigeria." "by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident will form the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been revived several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." no one remained behind to count corpses, "" said a man on Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were fragmented, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt by the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misappropriations; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"even one step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsely explain the picture taken from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Than Being said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she used the image taken from the DR Congo to illustrate this information."</seg>

<seg id="919">"instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message, supposedly written by a" "Father Juan Carlos Martos" "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnamese and declared it to hoax."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message contained in the picture taken from the DR Congo, the organisation of the Clarettin missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distance themselves."</seg>
<seg id="923">"there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. it is therefore worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently have a share of drinking water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue, and the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy is to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and spectators and they have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against" fake News. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be detached from context or completely misused way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, every examination of false attributions should also take into consideration how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name untranslatable (e. unsurpassable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all."</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish soportea).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist from" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Pray your parents in recognition of how they have strived for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The convenience or laziness you feel after you have warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these" confusing "words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are."</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">"triggered by the monsoon, which normally begins at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country."</seg>
<seg id="972">"after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud waves."</seg>
<seg id="973">"more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations."</seg>
<seg id="974">"the rains left on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased."</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flood water in Tawalama town with water stands up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">"Sri Lanka's deadly flooding worsens the Dengue fever, Save the Children, after further rainfall are already on the way."</seg>
<seg id="980">"this morning the Neluwa bus was standing in the high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded due to the water level of Morogoda Ela."</seg>
<seg id="981">"the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations, and further five are ready to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants of their flooded villages."</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and start-ups have also decided to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance.</seg>

<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks for anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">"last year after the disaster of the Roanu tropical storm, PickMe introduced a" flood aid "key which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. they were then sent to the Sri Lankan Red Cross free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="990">"they also launched a" SOS "button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and landslides."</seg>
<seg id="991">"the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, in which several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need of security and provide aid measures."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on April 3, 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on April 3, 2017, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the nesting of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the resignation of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debts will be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interest in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to deal with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available for royalty free, contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it says:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what are the real costs associated with."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on the side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book titled" "Collective Remembrance" "gives his friends and his family a voice who wants to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in jail for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken part in Adra as a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that they were contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his whereabouts remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Siegel, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles blend with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in place, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria, but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not complete this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prose book, which she wrote in 2012-2015 to her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger at a corruption case, where a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants on account of intresting 54 million Metials (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the Mozambique airports, the Cambaza Council between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-press to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to resume its director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and demonstrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambian social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been reduced."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious that Cambaza is willingly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't have any moral ethics:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the State because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served in the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to Samora Machel prison, and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mozambique Channel, but also as a sharp, concise and - by the way - prophetic speakers."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious person is capable of all, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that he's not so. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is at the same time criminal. "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kickpea or Spindbse.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmese words with different meanings that have the same letter sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookeutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it deletes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should instead do is carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next door.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(splinters)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who are spreading hate speech, receive quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to envy their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that keywords of keywords are often a cat and mouse game, using social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author gave his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" chair "or" pea curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified messages."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate language but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post states" If you are a doctor, do you then heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the region of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">For his failure Facebook was criticized for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on his burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition ensured tension in this actually uncomplicated case, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but in early 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-experienced Internet users are used to using circumnavigation tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the world's most famous country when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to remain locked, several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now submerged."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content is, in spite of the legal ban, available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in mind to lay snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed fashion."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a retreat from Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I was at home, when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the river Rapti."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was in and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood face to face with Tigers:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he immediately sets out, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wild animals is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to take photos of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was convicted by an Appeal Court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also not by name is widespread among men. however, they have far less rights to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe, in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, stepped into a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pap has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices, such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion round, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a custom which they all maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call it on his name from now on."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word Patriarchate before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Painted from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition where married women should never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only kicked in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole anthroated frustration come out against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the rush of adrenaline, having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"over the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women into the head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed, and I stopped carrying him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ceased altogether, but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to take care of who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say something loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them that's okay, but some wanted a salty curta, a wide shirt over a pant, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, morals connected with the Saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) in a discussion so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a couple of times, but stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news from those who experience it themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they admitted that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman at Zambézia at the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on male-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, for presumably disbelieving rituals, has commissioned cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also alludes to the fact that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power, who generate wealth."</seg>

<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" "Subversion" "after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to remove Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in a statement on June 30:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Lius wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits that they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad expressed that the Americans" wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he assists him in his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy attracted a furious answer from China, with the statement of the State Department that" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical provision of its choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>
<seg id="1658">"I urge China to unconditionally release the Nobel Prize winner # LiuXiaobo, so that he can go into proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo"</seg>

<seg id="1660">"German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hoping that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs, and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources in Peking of the Reuters news agency reported that China had big concerns about whether the fuss around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and to give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius attorney told AFP that Liu Mrs., Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry called on China to release Liu for humanitarian grounds in an Declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments that he, regardless of where needed. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will ultimately receive it."</seg>

<seg id="1673">"the Council of mainland China in Taiwan urged China to release Liu on June 27, and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mei-nu, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in a statement on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old Leier appears again from the authoritarian rulers who are pretending to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it is better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred the corresponding questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls upon Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it correctly associates and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who do our prime minister have to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the Journey of a Decade magazine expands to Bejahung, Singapore, and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumors about certain parts of the world revealed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question posed by me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," "I replied." "I'm from Canada." "I live in Japan since 1994."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"many Canadians perhaps cook internally before anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we often say" apologies. ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be pious - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "Simpsons" "(who has one's Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really was a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major property of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show Canadians are more than just "cute." our prime minister has made Canada really sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend does.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The Dictator" "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the rule of Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"11. rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program of" amendment "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons viewed by the Junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems the junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists sit in prison, because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Africa "houses migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez is head of a small hotel in Tapakula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border from Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way to migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican female, a small woman with a coral-pink brillene frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 nights sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also have slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has recently arrived."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yogurt moustache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he says smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they went to greet them, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the town, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his office."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapeachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travellers always consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she flicks in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots, which she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she briefly imagines her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang, by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi, received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities continue to use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those living in distant, afflicted ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often organize extreme censorship and monitoring measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" "Images from mainland China" "(the" "showy" "), published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policeman checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"in addition, a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system, and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions given by the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "to be registered at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stowed to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice echoing through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble."</seg>

<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you liberate the mind from the lamp, but it is simply not interested in the slightest."</seg>

<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice, after you have shook it all the way to the office of security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"Colonel Ghassan starts to say:" let me hear you cry "Allahu Akbar," or you are only brave enough to scream when we are not close. "</seg>

<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was my foolishness, vanity, perhaps the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I answered: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed set is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a psychological torture I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>

<seg id="2036">"otherwise, they probably assigned me a bigger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one other prisoner, and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission."</seg>

<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell genome was a "self-service."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no striking facades can be seen in me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect the state security against us and prevent us from exposing the traitors and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">Here is no home that is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the interrogation room and meet on Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he comes to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he begins a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that glide on him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life as you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am used to not answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and strokes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said I had to get used to being punished, although I had done nothing to earn this penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner suddenly rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe with a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a giant cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them switched off, while I was still on the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice, which is why I stopped screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, which is why he picked up an electric rod next to him."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity went through my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect electric conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which seemed to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful."</seg>

<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can sympathise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't open it openly, he has a special dislike against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a" Palestinian refugee from the second generation, "he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while he poured into water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the lugs speak lukewarm coffee and the wavens of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary groups supporting the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual incenser Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputy and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" just "was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who continued to use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an ever-clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender norms by depriving his vision of the fate of Arab women who marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently settled woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of countless women, who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'honour killings' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can" "be detained indefinitely in prison", "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs's music is very popular, and is well-known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been fed me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse is repeated conspicuously:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to remember that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts, but was only a modified version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not renounce Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nude, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nude, who was to work on behalf of the Caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did not do anything with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association, arguing that they have critically commented on the problems caused by the deep-rooted corruption in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind of induced democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as this is concerned, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trucks, drums and dancing were handed over for over a thousand years and from a time that armies from the west of Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous population of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to catch a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two forlorries are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outside appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Frisbee" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair dressers and to receive training in the hairdresser, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla warfare" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it even more important, people who feel empowered to receive affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, who encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to a rhetoric of war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must unite and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more need."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to deliver letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former combatant led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has someone written something so beautiful, so I answer it." suddenly tears came to me about the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined by a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as early as war, and the FARC had already been in hiding."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"one of them is worth overcoming all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people, even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which hangs over the local LGBTQ community, is not only made overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken over the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that deal with the dragging, torture and killing of queens in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned about the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"in the end, she moved to the USA out of fear for her life."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechnya friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya, who can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round by WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on October 10, 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, do you care?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything together and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got drones."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to return to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, a car was standing under the window with darkened windows and a plate plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I'm actually trying to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who are dortt?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Gaddafi's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are detained there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically submerged to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports to date. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings from people belonging to a so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003, I was already known all over Grosny, when I still lived there - and I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to lead us to" "civilisation", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even curbed a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold on?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who smiled and laughed beforehand, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"at that time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there are no gay men."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet it exists - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transillables to men who love males, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families, and to follow a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian provinces, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are seeking employment, completed primary school, completed 55% secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to annihilate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone oral speech or wearing Arabian clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances surrounding the Arab ancestor, human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreatable depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why do I not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional?"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still passes through the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is well known and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speak on skin colour, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, which relate to both gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in historical regard a degraded and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement total silence, no matter how many black women try to teach them of better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move us into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming itself (example: Africa-Womanism: how we can reconquer ourselves) states that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of Waterkeeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on neglected, poorly attended subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help suppressed congregations can tell their stories in their own ways."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena showed for mistreatment, Ada Báez also did not use the accurate display of Ada Báez."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women refund an advert at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reported to the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 hits and statistics 2 Unseen mistreations and a legal system, which is nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, flawed implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a research institute in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 advertisements for domestic violence in the District Attorney General. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace courses. 86% of women's adverts came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who don't do that," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since there is no separate crime in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, a woman died every ten days in Paraguay because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should not be regretted forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but for two years she bore the psychic force - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I first read about it, I always thought that this happens only to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told us how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked to please him for so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not native to Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreating them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women, who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorian's case, everything began with mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"the authorities stayed with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach to lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed at the Paraguay Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürsten)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain feminities into an independent criminal act and to punish tougher as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the law text has been modified in some respects to also win the deputies for the law that advocated the fact that the path for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original draft of the bill was intended to cover most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves, if they just want to reimburse and receive a secure housing, to raise the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: right now the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambib national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently staring a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"GM: in your opinion, what are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?"</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a mover."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and chances of development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and the internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what's the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines can only be made accessible to payment (the so-called Paywall), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredded, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many salads he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green colour or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereals or carrots. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned with the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but he has no need for it since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if a boulder is lying in a river in order to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger all over the world: open source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red reddish salat of the Outreddish variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow them - two aspects that are forbidden and / or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerienced professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, peasants' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the open-source movement does not concern GM crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered in August and September 2016. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds with free access to their seeds, as opposed to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it either not at all difficult or difficult to use for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat have been patented in an even larger style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases with more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predicable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property encourages other breeders as" patents and the protection of plant varieties innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is made impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is bothering with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we don't really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves, and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation is needed massive herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such as those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative due to the avoidance of plant patents:" "it looks as if I was trying to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent you are protected 20 years before competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seems to be the leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, is an open source seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeding are different from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"one explanation, however, is not a law; now it is at the Governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems for which the official start of the start should fall for the planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, to exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even though the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is nevertheless for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It is possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, a charge at the national Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also, afte documented the blocking of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to trial against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack on chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which resulted in inhabitants being transported locally or through tunnels and control points of smuggled food."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that there is now more and more recognition."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of about 12.700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels made of plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started producing" "fungal seeds from the regions" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons" ": breaking the siege."</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">"spread of a culture of self-sufficiency by using food leftovers (such as paper, tea, coffee, cardboard, etc) for the extraction of new foods."</seg>
<seg id="2827">"creating new jobs, especially for women who work at home."</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes.</seg>
<seg id="2829">"he said," "We hope to spread this idea around the world, so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a statesman.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks spread out in the northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European Forest Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos alone, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the county of Lisbon."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the federal government of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"according to Pedrógão, roads and villages have been evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">"this Sunday they did nowhere: there are dozens of open roads, surrounded by fire."</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval goes on in the same article by the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as citizens sought information or attempted to contact members, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they took advantage of their own civilian safety data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, at this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers stopped the attack of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, was part of the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt vulnerable."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes: the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum -which can still go for months after the application of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbanded lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some of Afghans operated companies, including cutting shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>

<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"Asharafs goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>

<seg id="2939">"moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed until May 20, as the prison management of human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of including weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on pro-Morsi sitting block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakarany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>

<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly endorses a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they return all unlawfully preserved monies."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, on the Nawain website, sheds light on how the Presidential plans look for the support of the bill."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the event."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to submit their identity document?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
