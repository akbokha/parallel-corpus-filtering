that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has investigated its risks and called upon it to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they give up . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have been saying for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly worried his phone numbers secretly , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit rating , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; amid this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convic@@ ted than all US governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ b@@ lower going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on . &quot;
&quot; but just like the technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press also can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they get in touch , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which still didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Secure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to commit wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; have hidden enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of news , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has station@@ ery companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a 2 billion US dollar sign will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and expos@@ ing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably , because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US countries , there is less information needed to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very bad , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see that some have started to change .
&quot; over the last few years , we have seen an introduction to more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an ho@@ ard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I burned up there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , close to the door on toes , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs in his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese pro@@ sci@@ ut@@ ors tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; thus we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one , who is still in sol@@ ace , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things that you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel this way if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please declare on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests booked their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and hab@@ itation .
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation har@@ ms common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots .
we also learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you talk too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; great works of art in your home ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been met before .
&quot; for us , business is doing very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other .
&quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can stay for even longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay starts . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; but to call it &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; is not just the right thing to do . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ tour of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we were to design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking lots belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a residence
&quot; were taught to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host today in 191 countries . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality there was already before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drive past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask myself why we can use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with whi@@ pped cream . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ rot @-@ gym @-@ gym , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hi@@ j@@ ab , my hat . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Bre@@ aking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me from a citizen to a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove silent -- as we drove silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ember not . &quot;
I stayed there all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have critic@@ ised the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ class and Olympic champi@@ ons . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I recently told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads to the person who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their rage , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to solve a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m returned the connection to God and to the church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if test persons reported messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather vote for military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims was sho@@ cking up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear harm us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not only about having to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when has come from my brother such a ver@@ itable young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we would leave our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe at number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who perhaps say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers is about to become a billi@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ itting took place in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flights , flying machines reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
they can also build up independently load@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; there are external commands on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other starter motors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most starter motors , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air@@ liner doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one mo@@ ve@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ ings , no further actu@@ ation or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right now is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the range of interactive streams from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things are conceivable in models , the rest will be learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if also limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the larger number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled , so there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there on Broadway wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just multi @-@ cell life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands upon us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Interfer@@ ometer @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colon@@ izing black holes dri@@ lled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the par@@ ting of my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , it was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and her through observ@@ atories , like lig@@ o @-@ measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a sc@@ rub@@ bing in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when the wave is over , the space and its entire contents will be stretched towards one direction and thrown into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really good dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and du@@ ped when the waves hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nuclear nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; for sounds , that &apos;s different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : w@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Not@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold Sun mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we &apos;ve heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- in practice or in principle -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through this op@@ ak .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own reflection . &quot;
&quot; by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly , I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first conc@@ entri@@ c run that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as lig@@ o she ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ sage bones for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different view of the events in space , the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; to say , in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
do I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , har@@ pers , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my um@@ bili@@ cal cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , stir up your life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cra@@ ve television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I &apos;m responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
&quot; each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode , every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts at the same time : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows that I created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a home , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just lying on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work hard , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I was setting up troops when I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a portrait of a high tone , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the hum@@ ming . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started with television production , when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a hum@@ ming , then you cannot strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being unable to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the bu@@ zz . I &apos;m the bu@@ zz .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burnt out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single job title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine sil@@ enced .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz@@ ing .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the hum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; lo@@ l yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re doing a teacher , being a bank@@ ers , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the hum@@ ming , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out late , late and she says : &quot; mother , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things are made aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and my bu@@ zz g@@ rie@@ ve , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come up , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sw@@ inging , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ ps and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the hum@@ ming , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titan@@ um sum , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t care how to work like that .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person would rather work than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst into soap bubbles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ med , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m going to fail and I &apos;m winning . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot;
do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
&quot; 15 minutes by piece , why not treat yourself for about 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the Sum@@ ming of Life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s just me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is traveling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I created , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I feel this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of being in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think things out and I will stir you up for life .
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; they must imagine that the brain is wil@@ ted with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , and the pressure of cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast sharing .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly disper@@ sed and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the posture of the brain . &quot;
but why stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; this , however , is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we took them to the exceptional stage of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we break these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we examine the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we passed the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ uper@@ ate to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide around 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; see now when we planted the cells : the same ape , two months after the irritation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since then , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ete them in man .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting with these great results one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
&quot; first , you must prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ge@@ aring .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy f@@ uses with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices - should not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a false belief , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ ian democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are bri@@ gh@@ tened , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the twin summit parad@@ ox .
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the United States , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; the $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar amounts to a lot of money , until it compar@@ es with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion of US dollars , which at the same time runs around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did not do anything except infl@@ ating stock exchanges and highly recommen@@ ding real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ alized by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors who , like in an endless loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently causing the circumstances that lead to the body killing him .
this is my rowing with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy following these conclusions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it moved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice wei@@ ghting in questions of state concerns . &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place in that the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and ex@@ propri@@ ated it . &quot;
wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics to the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y animals that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals that it feeds on , that they are therefore star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that har@@ ms politics so far that it itself har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the inequality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem with this is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts go deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has brought forth --
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or through something similar to &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in machines , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it take , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and revenues originate , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not in it , and employees who work there where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; please let us briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely sw@@ inging exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfect too . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the west &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is happening -- the realm of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now to repro@@ ach China , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells enormous to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Minister of Finance in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have also chosen denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , one might delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destro@@ y@@ ingly . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , unless we change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s Troika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone will not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the liberated centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at that point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; we have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel @-@ hair@@ cut and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows you receive this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after having looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can view all of them free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for free , do you have access to it , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data , in order to decide which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time in another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , Manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team watched the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards receives a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ experienced companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , you should make a good decision to make a decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by a very powerful computer .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we are more and more on statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
this does not always result in the fact that a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , they can predict - through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life - at work , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very wise people use in@@ conceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , drag this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for that and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will do it later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
