<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has investigated its risks and called upon it to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they give up."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have been saying for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and risking to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly worried his phone numbers secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit rating, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"amid this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has more convicted than all US governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blower going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like the technology of the government allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press also can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment they get in touch, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which still didn't exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to commit wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leck of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of news, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has stationery companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a 2 billion US dollar sign will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and exposing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but due to the principle that these tax havens work, Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US countries, there is less information needed to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very bad, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see that some have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the last few years, we have seen an introduction to more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made an hoard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while paying the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "where are you sleeping tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what have I burned up there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, close to the door on toes, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs in his classroom today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such a "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese prosciutors tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"thus we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in solace, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on things that you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel this way if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests booked their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and habitation.</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation harms common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you talk too little, such as" Hi!, "you won't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you talk too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimum degree of openness, for example" "great works of art in your home! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business is doing very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay for even longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay starts."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it" "rental industry" "is not just the right thing to do."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, you can compare it with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show one in a pub-tour of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking lots belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a residence</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in Share Economy, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host today in 191 countries."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask myself why we can use design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with whipped cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I'm introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carrot-gym-gym,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my hijab, my hat."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a declaration of independence for me, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "... in the name of Islam...,..."... "..."... "jihad...,..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me from a citizen to a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and begin the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove silent -- as we drove silent -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Be careful in well-lit areas, "" Remember not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed there all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were waiting:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people that were held for Muslims, dragged and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have criticised the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually say people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US's body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-class and Olympic champions."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I recently told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing, which leads to the person who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people going to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their rage, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised to solve a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam returned the connection to God and to the church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if test persons reported messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather vote for military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims was shocking up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harm us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective debt, it is not only about having to explain themselves."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we would leave our children: one that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe at number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air pitting took place in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the public. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting flights, flying machines reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up independently loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"there are external commands on the highest level e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starter motors, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starter motors, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the airliner doesn't matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moveable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossings, no further actuation or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right now is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the range of interactive streams from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things are conceivable in models, the rest will be learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if also limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the larger number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled, so there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there on Broadway wants to become a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just multi-cell life on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands upon us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colonizing black holes drilled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, it was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and her through observatories, like ligo-measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a scrubbing in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when the wave is over, the space and its entire contents will be stretched towards one direction and thrown into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses of relativity theory often lead to a really good dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and duped when the waves hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than one thousandth of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"for sounds, that's different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just circular: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Noto heard the following: [Surrender's sound] Anyone who knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold Sun mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- in practice or in principle -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through this opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by its own reflection."</seg>
<seg id="541">"by means of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first concentric run that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as ligo she observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sausage bones for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different view of the events in space, the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" yes, "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, harpers, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "kittens" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my umbilical cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, stir up your life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I crave television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I'm responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode, every nine days, four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shows that I created myself, and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a home, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just lying on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work hard, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I was setting up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a portrait of a high tone, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the humming."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's what she does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started with television production, when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a humming, then you cannot strive for size differently."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being unable to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the humming, the humming, the humming."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I'm the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, overstated, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single job title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mom won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine silenced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the humming was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "lol yourself, stupid author-Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're working, you're doing a teacher, being a bankers, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the humming, when the buzzing stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out late, late and she says:" mother, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things are made aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm titanium and my buzz grieve, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come up, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of swinging, I can't do anything except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax craps and the song in which it is letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the humming, but a buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titanum sum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't care how to work like that.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of person would rather work than to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel overwhelmed, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more do not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'm going to fail and I'm winning. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">Do you want to play? "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes by piece, why not treat yourself for about 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the hum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the humming, the humming is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summing of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but only one part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's just me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who is traveling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land I created, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the humming, the humming, the other, the right sums: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more I feel this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of being in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things out and I will stir you up for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the" "deep-brain stimulation". "in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they must imagine that the brain is wilted with skull-brain traumas, and the pressure of cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François made it."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast sharing.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly dispersed and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they care for the posture of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"this, however, is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we took them to the exceptional stage of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we break these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we examine the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we passed the motor skills range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to a certain degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand side, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide around 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"see now when we planted the cells: the same ape, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since then, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implete them in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting with these great results one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you must prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy fuses with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices - should not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a false belief, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenian democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are brightened, our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the twin summit paradox.</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the United States, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past three months, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"the $3.4 trillion dollar amounts to a lot of money, until it compares with the $5.1 trillion of US dollars, which at the same time runs around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did not do anything except inflating stock exchanges and highly recommending real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equalized by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of the investors who, like in an endless loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently causing the circumstances that lead to the body killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my rowing with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to diminish the importance of athenical democracy following these conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the athenical democracy was and is that it moved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same voice weighting in questions of state concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that glows very bright, it is burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- was a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place in that the economy gradually undergoes politics and expropriated it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics to the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of robbery animals that so sustainably decimated the animals that it feeds on, that they are therefore starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that harms politics so far that it itself harms itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" Demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the" Demos "keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem with this is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts go deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has brought forth --</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "or through something similar to" Star Trek, "in machines, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it take, how could it look like having this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and revenues originate, and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but not in it, and employees who work there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"please let us briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely swinging exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the Cosmos, "into units of" Cosmos "-- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers calls for" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfect too."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think from the west's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is happening -- the realm of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I can say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to reproach China, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells enormous to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Minister of Finance in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say good-bye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have also chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, one might delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyingly."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, unless we change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions caused by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's Troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the liberated centrifuges will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you very much that you were with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"we have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igel-haircut and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a highly competitive industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows you receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive to where, after having looked at a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can view all of them free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for free, do you have access to it, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data, in order to decide which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time in another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, Manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team watched the existing data on Netflix Viewer, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data-experienced companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, you should make a good decision to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening because we live in a time in which we are more and more on statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the Multi-Health Systems company here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">This does not always result in the fact that a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, they can predict - through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life - at work, in the case of law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computerized genetics -- an area where some very wise people use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, drag this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for that and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competing for TV ideas, then selecting" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball. "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will do it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
