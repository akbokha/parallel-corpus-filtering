Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution in which young people should meet today .
a chapel that is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official ticket encourages exciting stories .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this one who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the state government , are anything but current - but precisely because of this very revealing . &quot;
especially when compared to current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
&quot; in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ gent papers &quot; &quot; were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian Association of Meas@@ u@@ rements , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
her client : Napoleon .
&quot; since spring 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying department . &quot;
&quot; the original document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and , like all others , is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
&quot; the comparison of early / present is most impressive , for example , the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , thus 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mal reception &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers there today , but farmers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the October festival since 18@@ 10 , actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the Ur@@ gent Sheet , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the venti@@ l@@ ated &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place was first , and later on 500 seats were expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Rot@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and turned it into a youth centre with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural references to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular track will take place . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Pro@@ mote Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , led the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring a deposit money or to let their relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial differentiation . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ j@@ ure Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U member states Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the gra@@ vey@@ ard yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , thus Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; Wei@@ dec@@ eption Project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area is a lot of work , a lot of things have to be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the terms and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the parent company and crops it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bio@@ economy . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric system and is glad about the leader &apos;s promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ded until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; here , the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Agency ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state funding of barriers f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; moreover , the area to be fenced must not be tractor @-@ operated ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric f@@ ences project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running . &quot;
&quot; the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump joins the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the company &apos;s square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he atta@@ ches importance to it , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller answered A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is appropriately right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable drop of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable tr@@ ash &quot; was better visible on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
&quot; Lazarus and her friends , who set themselves up to place their words after their death at the base , knew very well that they took up a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a typical depic@@ tion of the classical ima@@ gery .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful men after long and often dre@@ ad@@ ful journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; her torch should not shine the way , but the hatred which is her only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminded of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British squ@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that is to be observed after a great season that included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin again .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there .
blocking critics over Facebook : do not adverti@@ se a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers were beating him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in the criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with his voters and playing his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , blocking persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing further than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to al@@ locate a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but this is exactly what is happening in digital mode .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable wall@@ ets had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the final round last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set out this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the home ground for action . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy as to how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Schot@@ ten on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with one occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the manager of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which again and again hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the building tru@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ outs is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
she even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in their Holz@@ haus in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with opa@@ que water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rental car . &quot;
there are no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from wave roofs that have been transformed into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago &apos;s Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua New Zealand &apos;s resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists more than 500@@ ,000 were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were sentenced to genocide in accordance with the Asia Convention on Human Rights .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is called in a report by Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , containing reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , reloc@@ ated to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an impulse in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - im@@ itating in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ li@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
&quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Minister of security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 , saying he has no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , indic@@ ted by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus said that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
the villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw rocks on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house , &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of Papua , by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined in the last few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ car@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ate@@ ire airport has arrived in greater numbers . &quot;
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; in Papua , they rarely have capital or necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua , due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Director Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the limitations of reporting were not realized in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
&quot; historically , the same countries have supported the O@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ a@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that took part at the meeting , but still wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led to the last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre tall , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , and the building cooled . &quot;
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by covering , exterior trim for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two profits , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very much valued five @-@ set classics remain the traditional value . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the candidate &apos;s job .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal was made to carry out the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup fin@@ alists will have the host right in the next round in the next round , in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among passengers sur@@ passed that more than 20 percent were deliberately smu@@ g@@ gled over the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally bore forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been late to discover that they had been er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously left with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - operated by a jet @-@ charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also found that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed , who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common objects that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave rise to know@@ ingly carried out objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they intentionally brought banned drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought about the security of the airport , and how many had deliberately done . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were wearing safety , those who fly the most frequently . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will first reveal another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number in the announcement of the recent quarterly assessment : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 were re@@ trac@@ ted from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations confirmed , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be collected - 500@@ ,000 - a million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum occup@@ ancy . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if there are too much delays , the in@@ consistency of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his former position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for soil @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt declared that he would delay compl@@ ying with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Appe@@ al Court in Washington decided that the EPA authority has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA often has not comp@@ lied the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and agreed to set the deadline for the implementation in an agreement , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to uph@@ old the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans , who are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , who flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; new York included in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
public health representatives and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen am invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gen on their request .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ du@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the documents according to the certificate , on the Hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard , to which the church or the patron &apos;s right belonged and not the other way around . &quot;
people also lived there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ler village of the village . &quot;
&quot; old maps , dating back to 1600 , under@@ pin these historical circumstances . &quot;
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and owned a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two crush on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded the first 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bell w@@ edges were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are managing the Hil@@ arius plant by the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er Rent@@ horns &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the village of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organisers have the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and pat@@ rons feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the country council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) called on to take his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a mis@@ match . &quot;
&quot; according to Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim , Mr Er@@ k@@ ens , president of Bo@@ is@@ heim , is not responsible for the lack of planning law . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen for last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to review the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a involvement in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and Tra@@ c@@ tor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal way .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and tra@@ der plan home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; the business association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants of the shopping trip to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite for &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer area . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action weekend , are Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; the trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; for the well @-@ being and sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be developed anew or again . &quot;
this includes both visitors and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , the King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will participate in five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .

Tr@@ ump put pressure on phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Fu@@ ehr@@ er of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President kno@@ cked him down because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA emig@@ rated to take over &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump terminated the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists launch rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , managed to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience hit very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens from Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were hun@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .
&quot; for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice .
a court physician lays down a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI acts , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding county were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote in their vote for the first time in the summer campaign . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore did not stem from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
&quot; but when the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence , and per@@ ver@@ ted the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ne , because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of bl@@ acks - crowded into a room and watched as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ der for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who are playing Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and presses him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; He , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona responds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but &quot; , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona tells the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed with a dream of mourning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and carries out Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos;s gri@@ eving speech &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down just down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for one reason . &quot;
later the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the delivery with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it &apos;s called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks sits at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a fo@@ amed street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the rh@@ ein@@ falls pose as a rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motiv - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ champi@@ ons - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; ESS exp@@ els them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , gr@@ ind a cor@@ pse in the luggage compartment and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he smil@@ ed Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being held stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bowed his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had yet to let go of a g@@ lim@@ mer of the pipe concert , five years later , there were big jubil@@ ations in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls were going down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown to be an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
quantity : I have finished school .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected some great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , i.e. in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from civil engineering studies ?
&quot; of course , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one has always other people in front of the head , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - one always has to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will disman@@ tle another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , an Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , the explosion on Thursday evening was to be done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence highlights the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said she is showing the obligation of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is said to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that breathing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to establish a community space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing part of the land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; while it is still going to take place until the area belonging to the church is owned by the church community , there is no planning requirement for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in front of such a common room , not as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent @-@ just living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; kn@@ it@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been postpon@@ ed last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 per cent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that , in this regard , one does not want to t@@ opp@@ le a bil@@ let between legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ s- and what is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - as well as the pitch roof - would be possible for the construction of more cost @-@ effective measures . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means , be this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot;
it &apos;s not as simple as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one is not going to be so right , but now you lean on the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common area - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the opposite . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to split up the proposal , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; two opposing voices in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; if we take the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown down on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on his bike on the bike path of the street Schwar@@ zer Weg heading towards Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road on the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the landing fields went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting car .
FC Bayern Munich must rel@@ inqu@@ ish at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with staff worries , FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender at the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the sta@@ ffs of German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to abandon the B@@ V@@ B with the B@@ V@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights will captiv@@ ate the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
wandering in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; meets the need for information for many visitors . &quot;
&quot; it combines nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be updated on the Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting location selection . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ path Ticket will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is essentially further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there is something similar in the city of Göttingen on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , like the planned star @-@ cast - the planet trail . &quot;
&quot; starting before Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ gged @-@ down Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distant sun is 70 centimet@@ ers away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed @-@ star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
boxing needs this fight .
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said later openly , to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ax@@ enko was holding a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks he &quot; &quot; see the triple champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact strength , then speakers . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Last Performance after T@@ ire Plat@@ ter
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connection point in the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , after that the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes to improve the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , there weren &apos;t the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s two opponents too much , and we have to go better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a fool after a kick @-@ off , the forman@@ ts don &apos;t want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three chain experiences than with the four chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ ising and we don &apos;t afford to play so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann comes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak of a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and be able to concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascent favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at the moment , &quot; the inner @-@ defense of the Fort@@ una says . &quot;
&quot; the guests from the Rhin@@ eland , as a light favorite , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep it away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( migration chain ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been constant over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans , in order to see whether they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete block was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s super &quot; , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the road construction department and transport in the government presi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three needs of rehabilitation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.@@ 30 @-@ metre @-@ wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is an edge mounting , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
&quot; the special feature is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips require the laying of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collective pastures in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is easily regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridge restructuring costs amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common for parties to pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise be difficult to get under one hat . &quot;
&quot; the political parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ developers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All on a table &quot; &quot; on the well &apos;s square , but is now on the parking lot underneath the R@@ ond@@ ells - and with it right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that is available .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums A World and one of the major organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel reports that he tried such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us Church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ er@@ platz , he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also the case : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ er@@ platz , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than one hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ listening with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in Europe &apos;s top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov solo trumpet at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trump@@ ets of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combine the desire to cross not only the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds as though in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz drummer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating whole art work . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ el@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is completely open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I &apos;ve been doing . &quot;
or do you think I would have played it ?
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
I just never liked being taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to be justified by the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will say to you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would hin@@ der us from working in order to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is without guidance from top to bottom , and unable to find a positive , memorable message , &quot; said the C@@ BS News in an explanation . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF Congress , Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for all athletes , who were caught up with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e re@@ porter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral P@@ act for Sol@@ di@@ ers Re@@ duc@@ ted in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed during a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; the Minister for Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ resolved cause of the crash . &quot;
&quot; she called the two other pilots , however , as the &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the members of the family stood arm in arms on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Chief of Staff was built up in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Defense , did not show Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of high significance for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , doesn &apos;t want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and was further informed . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired , taking the title &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , said L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family . &quot;
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was vac@@ ill@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ Tob@@ acco and who had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals , I couldn &apos;t hope for for@@ bear@@ ance . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , however , does not want to res@@ ign for a rapid re @-@ election of the country . &quot;
because on Friday he spoke for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party member from their state parliament in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wo@@ ve founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record her .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
&quot; the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the country &apos;s day draws upon the Prime Minister , and chooses a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in silence , one will discuss all questions if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ en &apos;s step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land trade .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has given immediate effect to her land trade , which she has received through the green country list , &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group President Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests greatly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she consciously decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the faction . &quot;
&quot; even before the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the attitude of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats , on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly elect the Land@@ tag . &quot;
leaving T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her past vanity and fru@@ stration in her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD general secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to sm@@ ash political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U president Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest party at the time before the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut down without delay and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are safe and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if eggs are exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not able to transport . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production facilities do not meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
is it lacking only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist are crucial .
I have already made clear many times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m needed for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and accessible foods . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pan@@ ted resources manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the football rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with security , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ writing and bringing it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but with legitimate income sources they must counter@@ act the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 by the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at the UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum total of € 4@@ 4.4 million can be accounted for in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( back then $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship exceeds the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be am@@ bass@@ adors and could simply find out such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million has generated a profit of more than € 10 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS , regarding Kat@@ ars &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot;
it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country .
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract anew .
Swiss @-@ speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; approximately 17 million small white @-@ white chocolate panels to 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss Life didn &apos;t want to provide information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual revenues of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock maker it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants do in the new tender , the Swiss will not want to disclose . &quot;
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss producers will come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
Swiss Sin@@ ce 2006 chocolate tablets are distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympic Champion Robert Hart@@ ing reaches World Cup Final
the three @-@ time World Champion will compete for a medal on Saturday in the final .
&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , failed in the national WM ex@@ cre@@ tion and could only watch the disc@@ us competition from the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meters , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes to the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
&quot; this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first day of camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing drau@@ ght vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; getting up at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children who grow up - nevertheless , they managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the cast@@ or principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved who is now supported by George H. W. Bush .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat up this fran@@ chise , like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I suppose to be his logical conclusion : &quot; wet American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka tells Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ pe Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it is often played like a single one .
&quot; in six long episodes it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men , who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can do everything for food for a certain age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger story and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office ran on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years ago and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
&quot; therefore , the two are probably delivered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Italian nationals sought to pay close attention to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out a report on large gaps in the foreigners &apos; registry . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is thus managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot;
&quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on sufficient human beings , EU citizens are also gathered , who wouldn &apos;t have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false al@@ ign@@ ments , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with ex@@ chan@@ gers , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to return refugee families to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is conducting such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers , to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for EU @-@ state refugees . &quot;
&quot; if an immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can return it to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy delivered warran@@ ties for the recording and housing of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the municipality hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the head office manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 % of donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger book , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter from their life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members going to increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly annual inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 , to 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on household income is likely to continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rises would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h business package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks as of February next , although it is said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; bigger &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank , however , stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars , and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations for interest rate increase , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening becomes even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; income from the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation fell from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the high Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , taken before the sexual intercourse , can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now from the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move , announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious agents .
to take pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; appropriate participants will be identified in clinics including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted at needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to release the award .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend .
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard into something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp analysis of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold to US $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as &quot; &quot; main carrier and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this implies Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he began &quot; West@@ co there when he &quot; was the high school in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , while Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; has bitter@@ ly said about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has held back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with senior employees , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information thrown into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s relationship with television extends decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of positions that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Twitter practice under control , according to six former campaig@@ ning officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption contains a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we do not know - that Tr@@ ump@@ et T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions have included even more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep his anger away from him , then their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king pumping controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump materials that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May about the superi@@ ority of the advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons , doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they originate from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously offered a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former head of staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
&quot; in this summer ( virtual ) postcards , the police in all of Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action following the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many volati@@ les hidden on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
we have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online pla@@ gues have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; row
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the base of war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do Soli@@ hull road called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council in order to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal budget , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenue from the tourist tax was lost . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming into the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers due to the installation of a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has a long time construction sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on top of the upper city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , further explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he already led conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; when asked for the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant that is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Off@@ ers sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special educ@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Panel received the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal , &quot; referring to the people committed to the business . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N channel reported that there are already the first events of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a longer time to get involved in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump@@ et election campaign team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ators focus on several men acting in the election campaign as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lican .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special En@@ ter Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be raised .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called dock chambers .
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channel , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his wife @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also had a conversation . &quot;
&quot; law experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension showed that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that he was not being investigated by the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been al@@ oud to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump accused him of setting up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff . &quot;
this triggered speculation whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presi@@ dency of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented bill on Thursday , after which the Special En@@ ter could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf . &quot;
this was shared by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion pound and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ fts to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this cow@@ ard , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key location . &quot;
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea level , albeit only to a small extent , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these scientists do not lead to the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ice @-@ ch@@ aps of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ car@@ ded over the past few decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to this decline .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus t@@ aps into the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants house tari@@ ff for personnel
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ancies , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration are inst@@ inct . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 trainees completing their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
&quot; around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places , which were to be reloc@@ ated this year . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
at the moment there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the application shortage in the future . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented in@@ wards and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; competition &quot; &quot; of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who are sick or age @-@ related are excluded from the service . &quot;
so high time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , head of faction of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party . &quot;
&quot; he made a big surprise for a big surprise already in the chal@@ k day , when he openly questioned the head@@ count of personnel and astonished the other parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which permit a withdrawal from the municipal employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; says peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the public service tari@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only when one changes to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO &apos;s ba@@ il@@ out boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself as a detailed presentation of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all the accus@@ ations currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go away so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , the view point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also contro@@ led .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - athletic and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga tests for e @-@ sport
&quot; do sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; this has also been recognised by the first federal states , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that several associations will ascend on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified themselves . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal league to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even FIFA &apos;s football simulation will be cont@@ ested at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsi@@ veness are needed . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
&quot; positively , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are internationally on the go , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to fall to 130 million . &quot;
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write . &quot;
&quot; internationally , many countries are already on the move . &quot;
&quot; major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the football club associations in the Netherlands and France are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in Europe , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B vice @-@ president R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football , everything remains as it was . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; poison @-@ eggs &quot; &quot; - the egg @-@ alternatives for cooking and baking &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states are affected by the sc@@ andal@@ ous eggs . &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany .
&quot; in the shelves , only eggs are to be taken , which are demon@@ stra@@ bly not a fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot;
Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which she depl@@ ores .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t em@@ bed the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never be participating in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another , commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from the fall by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 because of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ che : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not by chance .
the FC Bayern tr@@ umps a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different to his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ che immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself the hur@@ ried rush to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign from the coach .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f experienced by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those who want to have a lot of food that you want to keep in mind .
&quot; so , who has been chosen to enter the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ran as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , that is his position , the white binding on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i was working in this initial formation , like the one who can take the ru@@ dder at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played trou@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal so , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches added to the devil come out to the achievements of the Asia trip ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot , did not fall negative . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy ran in front of the defense , both acting confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ es@@ ake Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ che said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what is going on here I already mentioned . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win each game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;
Al@@ aba motivated Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ ball@@ ers announced themselves shortly before the game about Twitter and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is quasi @-@ club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region respond to T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al is in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 is to stand for the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west border of Trier , which stands in the urgent need for the federal transport schedule . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) in Trier is aiming at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports , which has been sack@@ ed for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates within ten years after the master &apos;s education make themselves independent . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , says : &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire bis@@ sing at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , a CD@@ U vice @-@ president , refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , sober@@ ing is the current broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind energy company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies it cleared the field again . &quot;
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install exhaust gases from diesel vehicles , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of defe@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the failure of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but driving back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar

&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;

the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen as a protecting wild river . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most popular carto@@ ons in carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still living and working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he found himself among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for gambling cards - which fru@@ strated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the table today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures still find much spreading worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is reproduced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large headaches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert from the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ goat , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year existence .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organized crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front side of the room : opponents , neutral ones , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and ab@@ domin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break of violence and as the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust each other . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce &quot; &quot; in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car , and 12 times he was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twelve river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but for Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , there was the release of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country to its own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without hitting the drug problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a harbour worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now ask them : was his love of routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to get drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a medium @-@ sized neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trust@@ worthy of the Gover@@ nor himself . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former emin@@ ent driver Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few notes , and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by publishing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organized protests on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has been asked since then that it is re@@ group@@ ed by the government , because it is concerned that its anger has viol@@ ated its obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; by organised crime , the government officials involved and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces , who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and still observe the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a number of shooting shops with riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ eled nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they had fear at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when Ja@@ vier was murdered on the same day , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k @-@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition surprised researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; start@@ led &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years covering the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to blend better into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by eating meat e@@ aters , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of ro@@ e , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the chal@@ k time must have been , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the sub@@ marine equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ ters cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ mo@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , mil@@ lim@@ eter jams - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police first information about 17@@ .00 hrs between the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed together . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured parties . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of driving direction Munich , a round of about ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also happened on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade noted the license plates of the vehicle operators , who now have to face delicate fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
&quot; the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting , or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that you take your seat and thereby de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test operation is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available on many other road routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the railway station without cre@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button appears for the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train driver arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr marketing manager . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel often , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest sleeves . &quot;
&quot; for many times , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Are Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one otherwise posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Ferr@@ ell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; An@@ other polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinem@@ as starting from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power , which consists of the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter have joined with a local propriet@@ or who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Ferr@@ ell in mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt &apos;s in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; Ferr@@ ell brought the project closer , along with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; followed in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was selected as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long gone missing , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation of 2009 , spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; Das would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , of which also the other shops profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds out . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is being planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wanted to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - at the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ i@@ dens again and again very gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , too . &quot;
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; the new project , however , will probably not be low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is well @-@ priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping centre only by bigger companies , because the rent there are often non @-@ portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all : where should the peasant market hall be , during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or is it possible to manage the ghost bit gallery before selling all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the amaz@@ ingly many - as I find - po@@ int@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg won &apos;t be any place any more . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after revealing a secret diplomatic message about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has combined expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the for@@ mb@@ ar@@ age of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took up contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ose Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ y@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was in fact only a few days after the book was published , forcing Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome sort of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; even now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aking ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears in the hands of a hands @-@ on hands from the United States &apos; discipline of discipline like King Kong .
&quot; when they cold your speech , they have won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , as everything was in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation .
University of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University due to murder
&quot; a nation @-@ wide hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of the event , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively search for the susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now in absence and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has given the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
everything was announced and everything is being implemented .
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov stated problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
this was shared by the corporate groups .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed by any health distur@@ b@@ ance , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ L@@ eto@@ em@@ itt@@ el . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce startup but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups to provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low cons@@ ulation results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the fin@@ anz@@ Technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Business lets Con@@ ver@@ cent companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; Sur@@ veys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which enables employees to report bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has deployed for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company Con@@ ver@@ cent sets up , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - how discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality can be identified faster and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more than ever expected from their workplaces . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools promise third @-@ party commitment , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees will ask , &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , thus saving . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated staff , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will gain new insights into the employees , and it is hoped that in the long term , this leads to a better bond between employees in an industry known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes present a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ atic Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the first six seasons in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises . &quot;
they will last 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if it adds a further point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they are plot@@ ting on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a door@@ posts , will not be easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to factor checks , which may indicate results of the fact review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fak@@ ed parties are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and to work on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shire , with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melan@@ cho@@ lic . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ oni May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) it seems all too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , view the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the era of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who possessed something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er@@ man who hid Dar@@ r@@ ell &apos;s family for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is represented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys with a talent to adverti@@ se yourself .
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature back ever since . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
&quot; campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle , covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf &quot;
&quot; with the cover of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan hidden . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think of that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount and cost the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on retirement and transport in the officers &quot; cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is a routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the meetings took place under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number . &quot;
the government is pulling up the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the forces of air and the na@@ vy have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head@@ land for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the great suit in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan released another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servant , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least with regard to the European Union &apos;s reform requirements . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially un@@ named officer , who sought asylum in fear of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after pur@@ ging doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by issuing the US the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that benefits our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for track @-@ platform shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past months , over the future of the platform shuttle has been denied - now it is supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the eastern track on which the Tourist Rail@@ road is going . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the circuit break@@ er in the long term , construction work on the track should start again this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link , &quot; said District Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country is 75 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country , is currently being agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered in regular order on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the track is used by a large number of people in order to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also in parts highly b@@ auf@@ äl@@ lig .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex @-@ d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or the color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern sex @-@ d@@ olls have become robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users , for example , to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ ling one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy then ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; its emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what passes through the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that this highly developed sex robot appears in a time where the rights of women in the world are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most sc@@ ary aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the stoch@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the mode of speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
&quot; it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s sel@@ ectable relatives . &quot;
we are all going to ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bags .
&quot; less noticeable has been the power of Tr@@ ump@@ et , to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself being affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild offen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is concerned , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in New York &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a great round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ Car@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to slow@@ ing down what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was sorry , while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to kill@@ ings after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year jail sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the district wat@@ chers from Sag@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students went to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and left it out of his chickens .
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z . &quot;
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln wearing cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny was to be free .
she wished each district wat@@ erer to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , followed the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick time was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only leaves students very reluct@@ ant because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door @-@ äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were deta@@ ined for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camping people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp , and place anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW Group have offered software updates for around 5,@@ 3 million cars in total . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
&quot; Anja S@@ met@@ anin , from the ACE Auto Club Europa , gives assessments : &quot;
is the new action obligatory ?
no . the software updates tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have &quot; &quot; Schumann Software &quot; , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler reported to write to each person concerned .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the frame . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions go altogether ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the slopes depend on the commitment of the producers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW concern ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive drop in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first award ceremony , under President Tr@@ ump , promises to be political . &quot;
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that burden me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , that she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a City Buil@@ der since 31 years .
and the work makes him still great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice , there will be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as an underground building law authority , the applicant has to provide appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the city and itself is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the st@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life @-@ worth , &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen Park have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium san@@ itation is still subject to change . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike at about 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is a lot of room for a c@@ ity@@ master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dening , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what it fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring municipal building master emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the City Buil@@ der bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes himself : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to high@@ - and civil engineering , construction management planning , under@@ mining opportunities , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gar@@ dening department as well as an underground construction law authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : South track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a pink roller and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put himself in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay of delays and the costs for rail replacement transport , P@@ ön@@ tal of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the South railway line could be run without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of them were concerned about the long haul . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an eating more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also work with humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found out that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was nevertheless accommod@@ ated , did not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial action of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i had grown in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant @-@ promoting cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressed in the pen role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wishes another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given a great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; in this way , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ estones for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers were always looking for a certain concern to Berlin before elections . &quot;
&quot; the most important wish of the electoral campaig@@ ners was , however , not a distur@@ b@@ ance from the party headquarters , but not a head@@ wind from the federal government . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach with a head@@ wind . &quot;
there were downs .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber from the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Euro MP Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , the most surprising fac@@ et of a Green Party , over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) . &quot;
&quot; five months before the election of the country , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the CD@@ U and F@@ DP opposition . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ gh@@ tens , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ lins were reached the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the over@@ stepping of the green de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD states .
nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sp@@ un the party smooth . &quot;
the comrades in the weeks afterwards lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped up again .
&quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next draft .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did so pretty much wrong what you can do wrong .
&quot; ever since , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust mood and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l has always tried to emphas@@ ise accents in the last few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they allowed him to grant him , because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l has no guilt on the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; in the meantime , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ anner presents her own career fairs on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ern@@ sey has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament by the state list of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony , so the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate willing four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Mr Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
anyone who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get assistance from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 there are in sensi@@ cal re@@ development areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to also promote interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the presi@@ dium of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a renovation area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of any interest , to san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge was held on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the existing survey would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the decision will be made as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the forec@@ ast@@ le investigations .
&quot; the aim is to evaluate and decide the urban development issues , and decide when to renov@@ ate and to what extent . &quot;
there will be a renovation note in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to mind once more and make a picture of the situation , promised her . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; , &quot; in which , among other things , the structural condition and the restoration intentions are concerned . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; budget@@ ary and housing el@@ bows , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , notice that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who first comes first , advises . &quot;
&quot; no funding can be made for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; village centre II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military sent to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the record of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the representative naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn event , and until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team for the return flight would be needed due to restric@@ ting the hours of service . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo surgery , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the Pres@@ idential aircraft performed in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area , to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential campaign missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump talked to Si@@ kor@@ sky &apos;s representatives and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
leader of the Second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off in Kiel at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games still a flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has maintained the sense of reality . &quot;
&quot; in any case , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot;
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North ensure above all . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be difficult for us as always .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment of the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man not to the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) is at its first bet in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
&quot; he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ scho@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungarian , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , does not meet someone from the train@@ ee staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can damage O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress et@@ ched a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the O@@ MV , who together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Sou@@ ls North Stream 2 , are correspon@@ dingly wor@@ rying . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; looked at what the Group could defend and which could really hurt it . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer is revealed , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s rich@@ est drug trade organization : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 companies &quot; only with more state hol@@ dings and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , who invites the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;

roll For@@ ward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with firm contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 September , Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked will continue to be left out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked foods .
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ days , in the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita to lunch &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service starting from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give off , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the size - there are two groups , as well as sevent@@ een units - decide the timet@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz comments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is to be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - has also the charm that it proved to be the most economical , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , which it turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical , i.e. it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße with friends , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , however , and went on with her friends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
&quot; without prey , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers know about the long @-@ term commitment to production at their Glas@@ gow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company weighed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea biscuits in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie asked to &quot; express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow metrop@@ olitan area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the leader in T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all the companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross @-@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having submitted an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ana board insi@@ sts that the club always gave his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter revers@@ ed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator deliberately dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to over 200 Euro on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;

&quot; to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police search for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um arrived in the direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an @-@ driver tou@@ red the control plan .
&quot; on the car , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it may well be good that the driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses to the incident and the driver of the responsible vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse falls reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scandal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication with the German Press Agency , as expected by the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the master @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant , &quot; double standards &quot; would be measured . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a fra@@ grant fres@@ co .
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; strikes were a very normal educational means &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ ative book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) with R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment solic@@ ited attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s were &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , there are many cases of physical and psychological violence used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more intense . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims under@@ estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains , why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence on Viol@@ ence of Refu@@ ge@@ es at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many pupils highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ oline @-@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became hand@@ gri@@ m by the Ö@@ f@@ teren , if a dom@@ eter did not bring any top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is there at all . &quot;
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; you can , at best , submit it to him , experience it too late or not have taken first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger found a very excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ minded teachers who fed the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wound out@@ bur@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also threw ear discs and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ grant period , the 1960s and 1970s , among parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is , of course , dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed upon him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some involvement or co @-@ knowledge regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted the domain master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; one of the affected said , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was , however , that most victims remain silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even listen to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
what is the role of the R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; in regards to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ sts more intru@@ sive or more clear or more opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ sts etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that students and / or their environment entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity . &quot;
so he cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to an adver@@ t .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; was to be read at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem , that everything mixed and mixed up in the reporting became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Cathedral spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ led and mal@@ adjusted and suffered horri@@ bly , were all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; on that , as most witnesses stress , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what else was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger keep the ears consistently in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , who even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they were in a legal grey area , as everyone of us knows still . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where the affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ sed , and where the permissible limit was really exceeded . &quot;
but one cannot say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in the year 1980 , the test was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what has been f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally stopped .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; in the 1970s , his means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing the ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , he was also strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the issue of test sentence also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , since the cathedral @-@ cats played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and sweets alone , you don &apos;t even make a great singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic @-@ hearted , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of which one cannot imagine that he could even do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ es , still today , 23 years after his exile , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly among them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Cathedral spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect@@ ful person , to whom they still look up and ad@@ ore them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all that is accused of , are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the starting point , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally get in peace . &quot;
