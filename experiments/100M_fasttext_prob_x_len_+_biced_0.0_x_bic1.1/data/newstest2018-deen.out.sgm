<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution in which young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official ticket encourages exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this one who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bayern-atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely because of this very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared to current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called" "Urgent papers" "were incorporated for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian Association of Measurements, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Her client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since spring 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, the present-day neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying department."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the original document for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of early / present is most impressive, for example, the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, thus 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called" "primal reception" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers there today, but farmers of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the October festival since 1810, actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urgent Sheet, one reads not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the ventilated" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen - but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once closed people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüders" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, first place was first, and later on 500 seats were expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Rotsirrenanstalt in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and turned it into a youth centre with educational establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - in architectural references to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" main square "around 1856, the shopping street called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular track will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promote Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which should enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "says the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, who are disproportionate to minorities, led the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report of Missouri's Office of Public Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black motorists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring a deposit money or to let their relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which classifies the state regarding the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial differentiation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman's Weidejure Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU member states Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the graveyard yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, thus Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the" "Weideception Project" "as" "elementary". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area is a lot of work, a lot of things have to be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the terms and topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parent company and crops it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric system and is glad about the leader's promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be afforded until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and housewives it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiß:" here, the best foods are produced here. ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Federal Environment Agency (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state funding of barriers fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the area to be fenced must not be tractor-operated (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's electric fences project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump joins the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the company's square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN about the President's proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attaches importance to it, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller answered Acosta," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is appropriately right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable drop of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable trash" was better visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus and her friends, who set themselves up to place their words after their death at the base, knew very well that they took up a highly political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a typical depiction of the classical imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative to bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often dreadful journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not shine the way, but the hatred which is her only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminded of a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics track, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh brought naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British squad."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which have been reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that is to be observed after a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics over Facebook: do not advertise a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers were beating him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in the criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with his voters and playing his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing further than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's staff referred to as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call others" "intercession." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to allocate a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what is happening in digital mode.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable wallets had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters suggested to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comforts during the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who led to the final round last year in the Archerfield, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry did a great job when he set out this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," "said the player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open, because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them."</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday, returns to the home ground for action."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy as to how it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNust."</seg>
<seg id="228">"the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Schotten on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>

<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces."</seg>

<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Encarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's untroubled eastern provinces of Papua and West papua: visa-denial and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="372">"the spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanaatha Nasir, rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>

<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shuts," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, except that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to Jokowi as a" guilt "which he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, the Paniai casualties led to the last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they will never give justice to them, but at least they will not forget their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="440">"a day after having been accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his former position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is a deadline, which ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-related ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt declared that he would delay complying with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or to impede economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA authority has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius's Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen am invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promoters Tumlingen on their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urdubuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold" "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the documents according to the certificate, on the Hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a wonderful courtyard, to which the church or the patron's right belonged and not the other way around."</seg>
<seg id="473">People also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the magnificent settler village of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">"old maps, dating back to 1600, underpin these historical circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, furnished and owned a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in this way, the right to use a priest or to propose a priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two crush on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded the first 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bell wedges were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the steeple and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower of Turmzwerg still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are managing the Hilarius plant by the" "Schaffhauser Renthorns" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The village of Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers have the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade is only held in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance to Tumlingen and Hörschweiler."</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim resists" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the country council.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim resists" Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) called on to take his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">"such zones are intended to prevent" "saving" "the landscape."</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a mismatch."</seg>
<seg id="512">"according to Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim, Mr Erkens, president of Boisheim, is not responsible for the lack of planning law."</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council decided to re-establish the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" at this point, the issuance of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been entered in the circle of Viersen for last week," "said a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them on the occasion to review the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheim Nette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen and a involvement in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="573">"before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, managed to reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with rifles to block his way."</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really inconceivable that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our churches, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, who assists in organizing the post."</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman for the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the imposition serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI acts, which were obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But none was ever accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain on the open for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote in their vote for the first time in the summer campaign."</seg>
<seg id="594">"about the same time as the choice, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom has a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>

<seg id="601">Brooks formulates it even more concisely.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an electoral law massacre," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about Lynne, because we are confronted with his ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can't build a relationship with you, if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done through."</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of blacks - crowded into a room and watched as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>

<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgias oppressive moisture nearly eight hours when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"until this point the killings have remained an anecdote, but now when you stand in the same country where the Lynch-Morde takes place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock in their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>

<seg id="863">"that's two opponents too much, and we have to go better in Aue," says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three chain should also be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a fool after a kick-off, the formants don't want to catch any more."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three chain experiences than with the four chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we have just in the three chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are still better harmonising and we don't afford to play so many playing mistakes in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the play of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped early because of a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they couldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know where they are at the moment," the inner-defense of the Fortuna says. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"the guests from the Rhineland, as a light favorite, go to the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which one has to beat from the start," explains Fortunas chief coach. "</seg>

<seg id="884">Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started performing tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (migration chain) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been constant over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases to suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans, in order to see whether they went sooner or later than usually through puberty."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of assessing child as an adult is low. "</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe reporter. "</seg>
<seg id="998">The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">"CoE said he was also" "pleased" "that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules, aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs, will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make money loose with security, so that Neymar is underwriting and bringing it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich ruler family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but with legitimate income sources they must counteract the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015 by the Presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total of €44.4 million can be accounted for in the annual financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (back then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will be ambassadors and could simply find out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive, every attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with sales of €542.4 million has generated a profit of more than €10 million.</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline is writing the contract anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda an appropriate report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual revenues of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a shock maker it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">"as many applicants do in the new tender, the Swiss will not want to disclose."</seg>
<seg id="1170">"in question, however, only Swiss producers will come into question."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members going to increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly annual inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018, to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household income is likely to continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the next few years interest rises would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth business package, which was published one year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks as of February next, although it is said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates they repeated that" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "would be required to cool inflation and a" "bigger" "extent than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"the Bank, however, stressed that elevations would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars, and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change occurs after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for interest rate increase, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% has risen to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening becomes even worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent" "income from the coming years, but she added that wages will be" "clearly" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to weak pounds, which compensates for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall of the funnel.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July demanding an increase of 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent downturn of the swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the high Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-positional prophylaxis (prep), taken before the sexual intercourse, can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, now from the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as" "decisive moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prepositional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious agents.</seg>
<seg id="1298">To take prep prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"appropriate participants will be identified in clinics including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resigned in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so that when you push the door, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp analysis of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the Brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her late father, Colin is described by Paul as" "main carrier and the dominant personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this implies Colin's property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims to have ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began "Westco there when he" was the high school in my last years when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other Brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, while Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million."</seg>

<seg id="1380">"Colin has held back very well, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I really can't say much, "because the case was before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current strife," "he said, adding that he" "still hope for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumpet's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with senior employees, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information thrown into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumpet's relationship with television extends decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of positions that were to convince," said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping Trumpet's Twitter practice under control, according to six former campaigning officials, insists that his personal media consumption contains a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumpet's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials don't know what we do not know - that Trumpet Tweets without their interventions have included even more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep his anger away from him, then their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from provoking pumping controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump materials that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the superiority of the advisers, the president for strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can find out where they originate from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously offered a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff in Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former head of staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1428">"some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travellers on the base of war, who have negotiated a trench drawn by the municipality to reclaim a field in front of their mansions."</seg>
<seg id="1429">Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-to-do Solihull road called the "Millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council in order to prevent their incursions."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said it" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous resident said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more came yesterday evening, probably today more."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks."</seg>
<seg id="1438">"I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal budget, if the Council cannot stop it."</seg>
<seg id="1439">"a local people who didn't want to be called, said:" it's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of those travelers, just to be looted by another round. "</seg>
<seg id="1440">"the numbers have increased this time, and you even saw a horse in the park area."</seg>
<seg id="1441">"a spokeswoman for Solihull Council said:" "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible."</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenue from the tourist tax was lost."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming into the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers due to the installation of a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has a long time construction shuttles in front of the entrance, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built-in."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautiful bourgeois", "as Thomas Scherer is expressing himself."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on top of the upper city level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, further explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he already led conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"when asked for the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant that is public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Offers sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special educator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Panel received the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal, "referring to the people committed to the business."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN channel reported that there are already the first events of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumpet's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a longer time to get involved in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumpet election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigators focus on several men acting in the election campaign as advisers to the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Enter Trump has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called dock chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel may also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN channel, invitations were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trump Jared Kushner and his wife-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign boss Paul Manafort also had a conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"law experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension showed that Mueller won't be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the suspension of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic gives the democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but they usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey told three times that he was not being investigated by the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this reproach, accusations against Trump have been aloud to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump accused him of setting up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented bill on Thursday, after which the Special Enter could no longer be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, weighing over a trillion pound and 5800 square kilometres, now drifts to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"as a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this coward, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that the Larsen-C-shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never gone so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key location."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea level, albeit only to a small extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these scientists do not lead to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice-chaps of the Antarctic Peninsula have been discarded over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus taps into the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house tariff for personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to step out of the Employers' Association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new places in the administration are instinct."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now there are 17 trainees completing their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">"around 620 applications were recorded for the places, which were to be relocated this year."</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment there are 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the request of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the application shortage in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented inwards and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a" "competition" "of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees who are sick or age-related are excluded from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter races, head of faction of the CDU, goes beyond the common motion with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he made a big surprise for a big surprise already in the chalk day, when he openly questioned the headcount of personnel and astonished the other parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all the possibilities to be checked, which permit a withdrawal from the municipal employers association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county-related cities - a house tariff," says peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envisages the public service tariff."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money there is only when one changes to a higher level oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO's bailout boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself as a detailed presentation of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organisation in an opinion on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can evaluate all the accusations currently being collected, only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that his crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can go away so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" "Berlin outpost" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North-Palatinate, to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the view point to the lookout point, connected by" "flew" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - athletic and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga tests for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"do sports stars sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium in wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gays."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also been recognised by the first federal states, who are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"in the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, founded an E-Sport department in mid-July, and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire all new target groups for the VfB," says managing director Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure that several associations will ascend on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup "in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal league to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"computer games such as" League of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even FIFA's football simulation will be contested at competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long established itself in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsiveness are needed."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the custom player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobbing also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform on online games and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">"positively, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the go, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to fall to 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultants write."</seg>
<seg id="1646">"internationally, many countries are already on the move."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the esports betting provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"in Europe, too, things are happening."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a classroom, says Frobbing."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"according to Dutt, the football club associations in the Netherlands and France are meanwhile obliged to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in Europe," says VfB vice-president Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to decay only in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended on probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she showed no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance which she deplores.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz however, said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I don't embed the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, in spite of all my pain, which we will carry for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never be participating in the wedding of her brother or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the fall by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter, who was convicted in 2007 because of murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">The fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern trumps a big season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something was different to his place in the cabin, that was Joshua Kimche immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made himself the hurried rush to the arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach didn't announce it," "said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first use as Bayern-captain."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi was able to interpret the sign from the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf experienced by youth players, debutants and especially from the holiday."</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is best distributed to those who want to have a lot of food that you want to keep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so, who has been chosen to enter the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimi confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old ran as a mini-Lahm over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"on the right side, that is his position, the white binding on the arm did her rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimi was working in this initial formation, like the one who can take the rudder at the best."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a look for the whole, while many others were busy themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal so, to overplay his missing fitness (hardly folded); Renato Sanches added to the devil come out to the achievements of the Asia trip (folded also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot, did not fall negative."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimme, Rudy ran in front of the defense, both acting confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the namesake Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the game building."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game relocation, tempo change:" for this style I was also picked up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual this Bavaria-world is still for the newcomers, one saw in connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determines six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimche said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few crunchy statements.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard of Süle an interesting proposition:" "what is going on here I already mentioned."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria, you just have to win each game."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region respond to T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer companies (VTU), says:" "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal is in the infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021 is to stand for the construction law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the west border of Trier, which stands in the urgent need for the federal transport schedule."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees this as a signpost to support regional, but internationally competitive companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) in Trier is aiming at the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports, which has been sacked for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1743">"Christian Baldauf, a CDU vice-president, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, sobering is the current broadband expansion in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"in 2016, regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an IHK survey with a score of 3.4."</seg>

<seg id="1759">"companies are trying to avoid the failure of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but driving back to normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he found himself among other things as a draughtsman for gambling cards - which frustrated him."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said. "</seg>
<seg id="1783">"after stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in" Paris Match, "and then also in the" Stern "and other leading magazines around the world."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, large headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, an expert from the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-goat, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil is not only tempting for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" "instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front side of the room: opponents, neutral ones, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominals."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break of violence and as the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and although the terrain is even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust each other."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper" "Riodoce" "in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car, and 12 times he was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but for Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, there was the release of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without hitting the drug problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce Team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curse like a harbour worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love of routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to get drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days earlier it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a medium-sized neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy of the Governor himself."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former eminent driver Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military raid."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few notes, and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by publishing" SOS Press "in organized protests on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has been asked since then that it is regrouped by the government, because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "surrounded" "by organised crime, the government officials involved and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces, who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>

<seg id="1904">"in 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and still observe the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the best dinosaur dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the chalk-time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well-preserved condition surprised researchers, who describe it as" "really remarkable", "startled"</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years covering the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumps."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbieater, although it is covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now shown at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by eating meat eaters, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of roe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk time must have been," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk-time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, that stood on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved mored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protrude from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the submarine equipment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutters cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police just killed an 18 year old child, and it's still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one otherwise posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns alive body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return to Tweet on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people who cried out, and of a man who claimed to be Browns's father, who carried a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said," "Another policeman assured his rifle and screamed:" "I'll kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," said Ferrell to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 o'clock, she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in cinemas starting from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power, which consists of the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a fitting crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local proprietor who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared the bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"Ferrell brought the project closer, along with six other locals, the team of" Whose Streets? "followed in the years following Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is" not a Messiah leader, but a community that is coming together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 have marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmatical type of action, "in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone missing, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it hasn't been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation of 2009, splits the population into proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery says:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" Das would be real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, of which also the other shops profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds out."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is being planned exactly on the property where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher wanted to integrate a Markthalle into the new building - at the Beda-Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been in the farmer's market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maidens again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"the new project, however, will probably not be low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are the shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is well-priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores are rented in a shopping centre only by bigger companies, because the rent there are often non-portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all: where should the peasant market hall be, during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible to manage the ghost bit gallery before selling all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the amazingly many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg won't be any place any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is damaged, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after revealing a secret diplomatic message about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition opened on August 2, called A Becoming Stresemblance."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has combined expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formbarage of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took up contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppose Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelyseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was in fact only a few days after the book was published, forcing Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"even now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweaking ways to further inflame the rigid splits he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her superlarge signature (the" i "in her surname is marked with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, "whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears in the hands of a hands-on hands from the United States' discipline of discipline like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they cold your speech, they have won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons, which gather like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, as everything was in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation.</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a nation-wide hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives examine the stitches as murder while the police actively search for the suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in absence and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to submit to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the first six seasons in Westwood practised practical exercises."</seg>
<seg id="2268">They will last 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a sip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire, with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholic. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brioni May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, for at that time one lit a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grudge") it seems all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, view the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the era of English Empires, maps that represent who possessed something:" you could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all the way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit paterman who hid Darrell's family for seven years during the English reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later than his coffin was dug out)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's' favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, getting debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys with a talent to advertise yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed from nature back ever since."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and transport in the officers" corps. "</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is a routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wire-driver of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who have been involved directly in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to" completely clean the armed forces. ""</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uncomfortable in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about the increasing" Islamisation "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on the headland for soldiers, wrote the paper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the great suit in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan released another 7395 civil servant, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered to be the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least with regard to the European Union's reform requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is driving forward an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an especially unnamed officer, who sought asylum in fear of persecution abroad, warned the Turkish army in a few years" full of extremists and Salafists. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex-dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots using a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adjust" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex-dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot enables its users, for example, to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, unsettling one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy then?" it's called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"its emergence and its increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what passes through the boundary zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot appears in a time where the rights of women in the world are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most scary aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the devoured body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is in another context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the spooky way that one day his kittens will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself being affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild offense."</seg>

<seg id="2493">An overview of the most important questions and answers.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group have offered software updates for around 5,3 million cars in total."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"Anja Smetanin, from the ACE Auto Club Europa, gives assessments:"</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslach Stadtbaumeister, will be in retirement in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the job is already written out - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a City Builder since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes him still great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"so, considering the regular periods of notice, there will be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administration community as an underground building law authority, the applicant has to provide appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the city and itself is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the stacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life-worth," "he is sure about the Bauamt and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhofen Park have been initiated."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the KinzigBridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and stadium sanitation is still subject to change."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will strike at about 1.5 million euros," If we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is a lot of room for a citymaster."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what it fits "when new buildings are approved, the retiring municipal building master emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the City Builder bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything runs here above my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes himself:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail track transfer in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a pink roller and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a coup d" état, "said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch at the APA."</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrator, or the perpetrators, would have put himself in danger and jeopardized the train traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay of delays and the costs for rail replacement transport, Pöntal of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the South railway line could be run without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"just under ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning, two of them were concerned about the long haul."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall out, but they had delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a specific bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an eating more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also work with humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found out that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was nevertheless accommodated, did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial action of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri had grown in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens."</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Greens Federal Executive Officer Michael Kellner called on the rebellious Lower Saxony Greens Elke Tvest to return her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tvests must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Green Party (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true at all," "an SPD election campaigner sightens, when on Friday morning the new hioblins were reached the party headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without its own government majority after the overstepping of the green deputies."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD states.</seg>

<seg id="2653">"because of the VW exhaust mood and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now."</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there are in sensical redevelopment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg has taken over two-thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the supplement was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the present renovations are a" "success project" "- it is finally important to also promote interior development, not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the presidium of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a renovation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the amount of funding amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euros came from the country, the rest of the community."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate so Schindler, where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"but it also plays a role, whether in the planned area of any interest, to sanction."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area boundaries could also be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge was held on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"cellar presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme" Social City, "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"however, until September this year, however, the existing survey would only be carried out, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the decision will be made as soon as possible, so that the renovations can begin next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then explained that each commune had to carry out the forecastle investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the aim is to evaluate and decide the urban development issues, and decide when to renovate and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will be a renovation note in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will again come to mind once more and make a picture of the situation, promised her."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc", "in which, among other things, the structural condition and the restoration intentions are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" budgetary and housing elbows, "information about size, division and residents of a residential area can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "operating arc" "can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, notice that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not conducive to funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies after the" greyhound principle "works - who first comes first, advises."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"no funding can be made for later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2706">"finally, photos of the project" "village centre II" "were shown to make the present a" "tasty" "refurbishment."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers according to the military sent to TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the Connecticut helicopter was placed next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a fork lift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the record of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the representative naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn event, and until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team for the return flight would be needed due to restricting the hours of service."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you're locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"but their use only for a photo surgery, is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the Presidential aircraft performed in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential plane."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy commander of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">"HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area, to suspend US President in the White House with precise centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a beamer."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential campaign missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D amounts to 24,380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump talked to Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very well," "said the president," "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication with the German Press Agency, as expected by the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the master-master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen plant," double standards "would be measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubted that it is" shameful and shameful deeds "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and this is a fragrant fresco.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" strikes were a very normal educational means "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorative book" "My Brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "because all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment solicited attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s were" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, there are many cases of physical and psychological violence used by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims underestimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains, why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "Incidents of Violence on Violence of Refugees at Regensburger Domspatzen" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many pupils highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as a choline-ker and perfectionist, who became handgrim by the Öfteren, if a dometer did not bring any top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can, at best, submit it to him, experience it too late or not have taken first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all those surveyed as - literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"in this way, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger found a very excellent testimony," sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-minded teachers who fed the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always surrounded by grapes from children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to wound outbursts."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only bang with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also threw ear discs and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fragrant period, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, it is, of course, dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed upon him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some involvement or co-knowledge regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "one of the affected said," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was, however, that most victims remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even listen to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the role of the Ratzinger's Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann:" "in regards to sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... Busts more intrusive or more clear or more opened than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trusts etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that students and / or their environment entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link up his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violent excesses "was to be read at Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking out" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael hesemann: that's the big problem, that everything mixed and mixed up in the reporting became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral sparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were chedulled and maladjusted and suffered horribly, were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most witnesses stress, the theme of" primary school "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the reproach remains to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger keep the ears consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they were in a legal grey area, as everyone of us knows still."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where the affected may be exaggerated or dramatised, and where the permissible limit was really exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in the year 1980, the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "pitfall of anachronism", "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what has been faded in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I'm glad that it is finally stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in the 1970s, his means for disciplining and punishing the ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was forbidden, he was also strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of test sentence also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the cathedral-cats played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and sweets alone, you don't even make a great singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic-hearted, deeply believing and heart-good people, of which one cannot imagine that he could even do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive, like many former domes, still today, 23 years after his exile, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly among them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Cathedral sparrows are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respectful person, to whom they still look up and adore them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all that is accused of, are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the starting point, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally get in peace."</seg>
