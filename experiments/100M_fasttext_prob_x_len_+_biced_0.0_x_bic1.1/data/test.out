&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again with him . &quot;

the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and devast@@ ated by his death .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .

&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO shared . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
&quot; combining his way with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the sign of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this made Hollywood star clear in an interview un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a television with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she asks for a child &apos;s wish : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us from 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled on their holidays , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to feed the food . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot;
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
&quot; he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ wore for photographic purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting successes , but also for social engagement . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master Se@@ eger was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ants , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ man Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping riders Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential rank@@ ings are , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
over the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the question small in doubt and warns against what the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regulations , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore taxes for the rich would be increased , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in order to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dless . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there might be partial internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and re @-@ drive the coal mining industry in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas ; he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection treaty .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop in the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics believe him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each person has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a support for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women fle@@ eing . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many are secretly ste@@ aling from seeing no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; those who believe that when they arrive in Germany , that end is ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about the experienced , because shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not know to help , more accommodation is needed for them , B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in housing of the Govern@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some common shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or are accommod@@ ated together men and women , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
how very the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to authori@@ ze new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to take more action at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; would have remained to problems , which caused the contract to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ SC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the Board of Directors has today set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures beginning at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Assistance Doctor , Dr Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gil@@ ded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared sli@@ pper@@ y , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of the whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but were even improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows pointed out that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time was burning .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of senior officials were most serious , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s territory controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he died last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because it looked at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus for having called for support for elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present , as an analy@@ st once described me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave its role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference saying that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer labels . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor stamp as well as to the brand among which our employees will be busy since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I am saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on the pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ers when he picks up the victory on Ex@@ otic ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone which only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma delights fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winners , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ - years of age .
Russian Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff un@@ expectedly .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s close relationship of trust . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement from the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that Putin had ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became head of the protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s close friends , working as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retired on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so lies the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that right now .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - met great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - compla@@ ining post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .

criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gib@@ son is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be published according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart &apos;s blood , &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
&quot; ri@@ dd@@ les for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff &quot;
a man of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that the 75 fish could deal with Sand@@ als , which were sp@@ her@@ ed out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which is approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete g@@ alley in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the road . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a slope of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances , which the team worked , were tiny - on each side , they were only few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck noon on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and hanging on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when he came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and in the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building meas@@ ur@@ ably priced apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean that investors should in future be taken much more into their duty . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; Living &quot; concept for the next council session .
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be used as social housing . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; no matter how viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is escal@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is not yet complete : since the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion is going to run over the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planned political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should be bought out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in West@@ stadt .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , there will be deadlines in the West@@ stadt . &quot;
some 1800 apartments could be found there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West town is drastically increased , the goal of the so @-@ called mixing is removed . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
the focus was on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created at first for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many of the pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who follows 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to &quot; take 30 minutes to come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; launched deaf ears , because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here . &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close friends in hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also mur@@ der@@ ers who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
a breakthrough occurred .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast cl@@ ut@@ ched on Thursday to the title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result from 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ all@@ ine Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nes on the Swedish bar during the Women &apos;s Summer Festival in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that have a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the women &apos;s individual campaigns at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - including her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained became a force .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture blur@@ red . &quot;
fl@@ esh@@ y beams and dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ m @-@ beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her final funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed in bright shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female captain , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her practice , she threw out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in the car in a series of mur@@ der@@ ies
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks from Phoenix in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ics and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , playing toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his elderly , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself down on that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , you &apos;ve got involved , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund thought for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News said . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause to ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to run the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , said that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ guard system is used over large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana up to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 @-@ inch rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ res@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by glo@@ om on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ man who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high @-@ rise of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommod@@ ated to Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer logged near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities announced that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic animals , washed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated ones . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond , the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and sand@@ bags provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be over@@ flooded on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; stolen by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police informs that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the L@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital with his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , several armed fighters seem to have been involved , who were very active , &quot; said police det@@ achment Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and cars were also hit in the area .
&quot; it came to no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video , according to reports . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by an ag@@ it@@ ator on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three tur@@ ners , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally ech@@ o@@ ing the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and tou@@ red America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ists in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymnas@@ tics that can be maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym training . &quot;
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that is great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors , who voted in favour of a vote , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans were revealed to introduce the Treaty by force and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend packages , to improve the maintenance to non @-@ recurring times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance doctors announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have made serious concerns on the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and plan to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes through talks , in the government , strug@@ gled to take part and sometimes silence on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; it happened in a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the concerns of assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out additional work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ end@@ ance for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already pol@@ lu@@ te over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and the whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ zz@@ ing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility during training , additional training for those who return from a professional break , training c@@ ysts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education holidays and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were to comply with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;

the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the initial draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; thanks to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all , the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . &quot;
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture to blo@@ om election fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office due to corruption from office . &quot;
a Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture has led to know@@ ingly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral fraud because of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a passport with them , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their votes , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial ruin culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special selection court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses to be someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud all over the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent let@@ ter@@ press - in which the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the conduct of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence was made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban that political activists are working on brief@@ ings to stop &quot; &quot; electoral re@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed out her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit to applications for an automatic mail selection .
ban that political activists are working on complete mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of mail@@ ings .
the police have the authority to shut off barriers for election stations .
&quot; a change of law , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Leg@@ isl@@ ative Act 1983 ) . &quot;
ban on photography in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the staff enforce the rule that voters are going to the poll@@ ing cabin alone .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral tribunal found Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was ple@@ aded guilty as a result of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; of the election regi@@ strations of the town halls .
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only athlete to have Gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates &apos;s Doppel@@ gänger on the race track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures showing the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess that &apos;s probably a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another continued comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a has more than just the sun t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Gab@@ by Douglas Tour@@ ing , which is similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; died &quot; like a pig

&quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; and during the race , like &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he reached his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free style swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; &quot; color &quot; , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went as low as a pig died . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese swimming pool Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not know that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many were talking about him &quot;
Twitter users didn &apos;t stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # touched .
&quot; shortly thereafter , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people responding to the B@@ emer@@ ald on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the programme and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was sorry in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I did after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman moved her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ ter@@ ned how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ bbed the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she was again attracting and leaving the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the lining , pulled off their own trun@@ ks and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and she was not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knee in the gro@@ in and twist , while the aggres@@ sor is bent against pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the running into the face and move backwards while she strai@@ gh@@ tens the gun on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and strike the aggres@@ sor on your chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ tening the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s doing Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .

trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and lit@@ ter@@ istic lex of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ ped off his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before printing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to take . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to lick the flush @-@ button of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to washing bones of toilets , the task was definitely put under one sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial sheet showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom . &quot;
in the film he says : &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have rolled into a toilet .
there &apos;s nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; validation Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the direction of the film added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I &apos;ve lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult .
I am happy that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ soci@@ etal family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a delay of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were tos@@ sed after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had pier@@ cing holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror inflic@@ ted on the family , comb@@ at@@ ants of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug abuse , and excessive cries , stri@@ fe and fl@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the road and had to be inv@@ oked on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing did not force her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the delegates were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to it !
&quot; now that they are gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years of age . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ ministers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a delta is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ tion on the ground . &quot;
workers in the house administration will have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to the owner of a class B drug in commercial for@@ esi@@ ght .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will maneu@@ ver tenants who do not obey the house rules .
&quot; Angela C@@ row , by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits ″ mighty problems ″ in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now given the weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous repub@@ lican strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the multi@@ lane and self @-@ confident , Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within their own repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ aming false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group . &quot;
repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ors from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were similar . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I &apos;ve done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is not doing anything else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to cut funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , one wants to strengthen the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; candidates for the Congress under the arms . &quot;
Olympia : thre@@ ef@@ old fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to examine the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former S@@ printer and present @-@ day coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , released a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Red . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the International Association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credi@@ ting of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Red I was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Track &amp; Field Director Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have notified sports@@ men of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing activities , the IO@@ C has been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by IO@@ C prior to the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing tools are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to demonstrate that in this type of sport it was widespread and systematically dop@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after that , Russia &apos;s athletes were expelled from the summer games . &quot;
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ eu@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a youth @-@ mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
and Bart@@ oli goes back to the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather sou@@ ther@@ ly temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ call@@ ers went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful as then . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London went into an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the de@@ ceased Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting Gary to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton as to whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team wouldn &apos;t worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans who blocked the nom@@ ination of Gar@@ land , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers from the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .

&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his neck magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distinguishes itself as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish municipality reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity already months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ attered put@@ sch , secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
&quot; many will want to start anew in Europe , if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes on refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or displaced in the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chief of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no shortage of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s more stupid than it hasn &apos;t been : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites itself . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the electoral campaig@@ ners are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers traveling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t be allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are also practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and at the end count out the votes , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just short of the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality remains exciting .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from its big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distributing roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame Merkel for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create , &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you are at the right place in the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to big documents ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary circle is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group was not right , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Sax@@ onia than Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other German states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual poll@@ s on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , for instance , co@@ ols , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , you are crum@@ bling the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , you can hardly find it in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much of the game is at stake , Sell@@ ering now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the emergency and move their election campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the regional president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tive fighters embar@@ k on trace search for local voters among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ades with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from barriers
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the opposite is also commen@@ ded for the construction of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south is ander@@ ed and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says Florian King , vice director responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ els@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eks were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
this led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ ch@@ ised in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality demanded to strengthen the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute sp@@ las@@ hed .
the fastest was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue out@@ breaks in them , let anyone look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the end customer , so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline , &quot; &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; course of course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , he estimates &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
street refurb@@ ishment has been thrown back for two years .
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other districts where so much more generous is handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars are seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance .
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal . &quot;
laws are constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ t anyone .
&quot; other , more out@@ going points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time left before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and tru@@ ce law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère launches a second conc@@ entri@@ c run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and to push jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything whatever the coalition partner has any chance anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are also presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast methods for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country are supposed to check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some of them still work un@@ checked and leave questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly employed , did not let themselves be cl@@ inging to election times . &quot;
the inner security is greatly moved into the focus .
&quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; with regard to internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up high . &quot;
&quot; only a long argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy idea collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ ort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , too , is struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds . &quot;
he does not receive anything from a departure from the double @-@ pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re @-@ establish , do not make sense . &quot;
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; the SPD , however , is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk and say , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to further enhance security . &quot;
&quot; yet , Volkswagen is still g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel engines , the distribution numbers in the world are increasing . &quot;
but it is not in all markets .
&quot; in the recall action , vor@@ ti@@ ces are about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts to conduct modest deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , offer a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , VW &apos;s nuclear brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , and thus reli@@ ed on the overall sales , such as the company listed in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
deliveries increased by almost one sixth in the home market of Germany .
&quot; sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around Turkey &apos;s coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also bur@@ dened the EU &apos;s exit , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gases have been escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available . &quot;
the Chinese market is a great support for VW .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected household brand of Lower Saxony is still worse by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales increase . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
the reason for this is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models .
this was confirmed last Monday by VW @-@ representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting .
VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA .
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion , no deterioration will take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not , as it meant in corporate circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after the change@@ over - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust , comes to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations , as was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , head of bank Josef Paul said : &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; do not need to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot;
&quot; banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will be charged by private and corporate customers for deposits above € 100,000 on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been keeping 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the Chief of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for each million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now further reduced . &quot;
&quot; leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , &quot; economically is not possible permanently . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land , with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 , made head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently , no other banks are known to calculate the compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , the president of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and the immigration of investors threat@@ ens to compete . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be able to please that in terms of width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
solitary men of middle aged love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to over@@ look him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of Non@@ Alle@@ mon@@ ing Men &apos;s Middle Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ opening of sound plates is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers are more aware of their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and stu@@ ff@@ ing wild@@ ly before I stop , keep my hands and say something different like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though Soh@@ o &apos;s heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - still there are a handful of fantastic record specialty stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of numbers : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of numbers : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , who he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers assumed an impulse to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record shells , from objects that watch happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a record stack . &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month haven &apos;t listened to them yet .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I stum@@ ble through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of numbers : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a tro@@ phy aspect of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came up here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ality . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly get in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen age and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ t@@ aut pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a window @-@ shop as a big shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting of records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot; &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to smu@@ ggle the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; however , considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research revealed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by s@@ labs , while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises nothing about middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also noted that the temporary shops and restaurants often offered accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; over 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to uph@@ old the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle in the jungle had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested to effectively transfer tem@@ pos@@ u@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at random points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary temporary polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary flas@@ k . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in an un@@ interrupted measurement mode , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the advanced state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in order for it not to be chew@@ ed easily , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also f@@ uss@@ ing outer man@@ ure disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the shape of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was caused by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day , could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago under R@@ yan they lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began to wonder and let the attacks boun@@ ce off G@@ Bs .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if you were going to run in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au stayed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a vice @-@ president of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji just stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch down in the right @-@ hand corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u presses through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ cus , whose fans che@@ eks , fl@@ esh@@ ed and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked in a cr@@ ushing blow in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more amazing gold than these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was there when they called for the second Olympics in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written use , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph . &quot;
behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more accessible than the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances the correct term is at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 foot at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge but it makes it an even bigger one .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ breaking morning to talk a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for me .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t look forward to doing something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; she feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was called the &quot; &quot; Origin@@ alt@@ on &quot; &quot; in a contribution by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appl@@ au@@ ded the con@@ federation .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , receives approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and pastures with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the reconstruction of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and we have always resum@@ ed innovations , because water is the most important food for living and drinking water . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; in his view , he described the well construction and restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the high container near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
&quot; the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer of Lau@@ ter , who will follow Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured them .
&quot; the man called himself and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on his escape , and he will be publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; it is , however , a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man we@@ ars a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a person had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , free day issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG shift of 20 percent falls . &quot;
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for Electri@@ city Generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading system , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation further intensified , when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw massive steel into the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel groups price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import st@@ ole show effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp through her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teacher training she finished music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures arise in the old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ infected people ent@@ ail long @-@ standing events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on your own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz will advise you . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who sounds when a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have several options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ iors , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - this is true of every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
&quot; in Hannover , bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect of k@@ itt@@ ens rowing on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not allow the males to be cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens from k@@ itt@@ ens , who choose to find themselves in great need as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) found out . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sting of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or significant for the males , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ e is different with the ur@@ gency of their desper@@ ation . &quot;
altogether nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a small pack of little ones , taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; despite the small sample , researchers keep their results meaningful . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they swi@@ vel faster to the speaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever responded , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey has again played an important soccer game . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the arch riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even in the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of regular citizens , should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , even before the football , it is not stopped . &quot;
&quot; against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kü@@ r should be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Erdo@@ gan declared the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; however , in view of the dramatic experience in the history of the Turks , it is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; there will be a special return to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it only reached rank 6 . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ till@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez only borrow@@ ed at AC Florence and only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; he quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to wai@@ ve around one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing lock right in front of the games , was raff@@ led and fl@@ atten@@ ed mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with an opened smile , she was still proud of the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when she realized she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience burst into a storm . &quot;
but there are many more athletes who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship was positively tested by the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , insti@@ gated mer@@ ritt . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world so far .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had won so many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later after having found testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized as a bronze medal , was due to a verdict of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record manager and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a banned food supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans wounded - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; I suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are affected , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life district . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , popular among holiday@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express himself to possible motives , but probably it is the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai Media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insurrection or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits a great influence to the military in the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , will help itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine had been killed by 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; identi@@ fi@@ cal movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; according to several state offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ati@@ er of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already watching the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices during the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a commercial advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on the contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge about that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that it is possible to give right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee orph@@ ans or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about the fact that there were many attacks on the account of people , who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum accommodation have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ hand scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which then radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or World Records decide the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Centre , the easily over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
&quot; since most athletes walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of it . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , did not play a role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to run alone in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and never had a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been co@@ ached .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 a.m. on the next morning , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash desk . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so narrow
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed itself . &quot;
mail enters trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the coming year , the Post will also offer its electric transpor@@ ter on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to get involved in the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post office on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their own Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell also to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ das had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ald had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter is active in Germany since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ appo@@ inting annual figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; the boun@@ ties suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate management the global number five of the industry stands before a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P executive boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , will reti@@ re from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management board of the Executive Board already handed over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , sharing the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the re@@ unions , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to be a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; if the market research company will be leading the market research company in future , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , in the case of shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced a few years ago was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the most recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholder will be uns@@ ett@@ led at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; , &quot; they said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent at EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter imp@@ acted primarily by the lower value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s Consumer Experience business unit , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , tot@@ aled EUR 139 million , with a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in cla@@ ws in dit@@ ches : eight injured
&quot; in the event of an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ unden ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the Bus@@ ses of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their information , had to avoid an opposite truck , which partly drove on the opposite track . &quot;
&quot; the bus arrived right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police station Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ unden district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the truck and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of wastewater amounts to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , under@@ cover was established for these sewage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt , a new calculation of the fees for sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calculation period were to be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the en@@ grav@@ ating fee increases by laying down relatively small facilities with a very small sewage plant , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the underlying calculation period in all three plants , not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , considerable scope was incurred . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage in the wastewater facility in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses were due to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; full . &quot;
&quot; in this context , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wer systems , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage treatment association could not be extended by these facilities because it is about defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , it enables Snap@@ chat to around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flo@@ wered , property @-@ revol@@ ving tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
&quot; in the past , snap@@ chat filters have criti@@ qu@@ ed criticism in which they were accused of making the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and black@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat tells that it would have turned off the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the least said unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ si@@ ghted , but that the yellow face has been moved to the decreasing extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counter@@ parts - could tend to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same . &quot;
she said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely un@@ answered the snapshot . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer who focused on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; IS@@ IS secret service information fal@@ si@@ fied by military leadership , set up Committee of the Congress &quot;
&quot; United States Central Command &apos;s military personnel modified intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot , reported a review committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican members of the Ar@@ med Forces Com@@ mittees , Intelligence and Ar@@ med Forces Com@@ mit@@ es , reports about great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services , typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drawn a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , a Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated . &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command heads changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigation continues . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the high @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; har@@ med the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave too little space for differing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the democr@@ ats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were received by Cent@@ com Analy@@ st &apos;s complaints . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the inspec@@ tors of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts at times have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into service to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature due to his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field of women &apos;s hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they ended up in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work desk in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder out completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament to be the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro always feel constant and ines@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queu@@ es without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could certainly have been among these known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline was already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years were so spar@@ sely perceived that many people I had asked didn &apos;t know that it was an olymp@@ ic event at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; even though the US sent athletes to a competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes towards the finish , at the top and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also a further high goal in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic sea . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even whis@@ per a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel as being a bit tired even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13 : 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a secondary block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the obj@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to breathe . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia imp@@ elled the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ men .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ attered the country and expanded more and more territories . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in tens of thousands of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the videos circul@@ ating on the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how safety officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader in the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of exposure to the surface now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were so prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; until his death , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ar@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of protests prot@@ ested against elections , which , according to analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in recent months and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal res@@ ent@@ ment of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ ing flights over neighboring Somalia , although it was recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama have founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communications capabilities of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate if he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , in the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump broke down with regard to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to vag@@ u@@ ely keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone , as its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump tries to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ ump@@ et , gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely false , and so it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing them to aggres@@ sively control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand and say , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , there is Café in Green@@ point back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced . &quot;
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop selling the verb in summer 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people gri@@ pped it as the last loss in a self @-@ degra@@ ding city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu , and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ erk@@ raut . &quot;
there are natural tear@@ drops .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had been closed , she gave up the coffee cup for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preten@@ ded to exhibit them , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed cup of coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee feels like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt has a passion for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; appearing on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , quick snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick kil@@ n , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ ed , this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap prepared by the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the ways in which the country moved with it , no longer to be the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; Co@@ e said why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ Di@@ et was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and d@@ asser@@ ole were added to stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper drying fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
strange mixtures have been tried out because a calorie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has prim@@ acy over taste or even a healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - became the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household leaders , &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as president Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he gar@@ ner@@ ed like a million dollar man from the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs again .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was used on food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of bricks @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates had been cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot;
killed during bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game , in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant who shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescu@@ ing of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; he never saw himself as a hero himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me it is the true ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children can play with it , &quot; the image rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ sh@@ arks will only receive up to 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ eck from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span that for verteb@@ rates means a world record . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland ha@@ ie will be st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie is difficult to observe , after all , they mainly live in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ ie .
&quot; her slow motion was measured by her , when she held six animals with a transmitter from S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the polar sea and search for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher layers of water .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a conspic@@ uous carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
&quot; its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons @-@ seeking greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the lens core contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably on the threshold to become sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not by chance .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose bacon at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on flame @-@ flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources rather into a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focused on issues relating to construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel received the Message from Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; at last the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; street road &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
&quot; as it was said , building will@@ s can immediately report to the Town Hall , about the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , to settle requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other industrial enterprises , including the creation of jobs . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city of the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , approval in the UK is enough for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new workplaces in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk entity ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also makes it worse for the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to its large airport . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with readily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is in number 7 , Luxembourg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th position . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , econom@@ ists say . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , related to block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops backed by the United States say that they have re@@ conquered full control of Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
&quot; troops backed by the United States have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ tail@@ ing the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council joined the D@@ KS with Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out cleaning operations , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption Records . former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false speeches and re@@ actors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check through the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump@@ et critics , among others also the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already top@@ pled the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co has reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people with more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to meet their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had just been subjected to an I@@ RS tax check , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the voters and not from the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has posted tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax declaration of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these only pay USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms using ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders and fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant Prot@@ ective
wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements in people - throwing con@@ doms on them which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ bic .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective , and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , intensified its promotion by practi@@ sing volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to the air . &quot;
a breath is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last opportunity presents a shi@@ py@@ ard , who shoots a clay fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new building on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects are taken by commercial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ und - but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be considerably expanding . &quot;
&quot; the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sale ki@@ osk on the Rhine bank near the Rhine balcony , which is currently under construction . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed by &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media clock after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli pres@@ election because Arab guests had requested an employee .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel in the country &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels .
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance in the internet where people called the whole a scandal .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel told the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged &quot; invitations to Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; she said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; Israel did not receive in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in Sa@@ o Paulo Brazilian city with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the other members of the protest saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in stores in the country , the ambassador announced . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is heading for a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation held about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses were looking for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl over@@ lap
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun weapon , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded cash from the staff of the drink bar and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police don &apos;t share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance may be fle@@ dged with the silver car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ ger ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 hrs ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , are urgently to be reported to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants at their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first school holiday week , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the quiet leisure theim hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ rette with the visit of the stro@@ el@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their own prepared food like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and the b@@ olog@@ n@@ ese b@@ olog@@ n@@ ese were p@@ am@@ pered . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Night . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the journey home , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ ei@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day Pil@@ gri@@ mage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages have been met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next migration of all mini@@ regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the senior management round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various shr@@ ines were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was given to the open portal of mercy at Freiburg Cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , went on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ no sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s crosses and told the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgri@@ m path started from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse , with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is made up to field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from specially composed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish church of the local par@@ ishes was available . &quot;
&quot; at the stages , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day Fur@@ tw@@ angen was going to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
&quot; the day after St. Peter &apos;s journey took place , which was the most demanding stretch of route , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning im@@ pul@@ s on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the Freiburg Min@@ ster later in the afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by the co operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anch@@ or@@ age , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos; withdrawal . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ res created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the bul@@ k@@ head that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner set an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed to the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the final round , we set up a world record and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ du stated that he intentionally desc@@ ended on the track after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ di said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived at the target in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had disputed before the qualification as officials called him to measure his height .
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly remarkable presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April was in the middle of sex and mo@@ bbing accus@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if one looks at the first evening of competition in the bicycle , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of Port@@ land melting due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy fixed for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt is about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the Schmel@@ zer@@ ei from Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closing .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , last , due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ down with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L said that the value of contracts was already written down in his annual depreci@@ ation of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the melt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still a statement guilty of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
should both plants disappear from the market this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sc@@ aled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were in April 2014 , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a picture book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine went through even before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , which are &quot; mod@@ eled &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years in her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were once again high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but at the point , however , there seems to pass by on the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
&quot; in the true sense of the word , it is a super@@ model . &quot;
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; and in her free time , she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot;
&quot; community centres annually exhibit 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary equipment is rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar , are rejected on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell &apos;s Director of Community Law said that the last survey of the National Association of Local Auth@@ orities has revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only become worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed in an odd way - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the aid they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled the weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s campaign was charged for alleged in@@ action after it was told that their Camp@@ a@@ ign Manager for North Carolina was a gun weapon on a staff while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i agreed to have waited for months for the matter to be regulated internally , before real@@ ising that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the de@@ duction , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ent &apos;s Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining about local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that already at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was indic@@ ted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton were elected and appoint judges . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s campaign clearly showed that the media had ri@@ pped his words out of context , and that he would not be offensive to violence . &quot;
B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign to viol@@ ate the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
Tr@@ ump@@ et spokes@@ man hope Hi@@ cks was unable to reach a position .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now led a controversial campaign .
&quot; the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U stand out . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite light losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were re @-@ entering the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP , respectively , would not be represented in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the survey , according to the survey , only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which today would range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; arrived just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; twenty years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover as an &quot; West pocket format office . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , albeit tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phones experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the market is domin@@ ating suppliers that all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is for very many people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , an entire industry has grown around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the beginning of 2007 . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; today , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in community growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect which part of the advertising page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Her @-@ Fi@@ ght Bet@@ ween the C@@ los@@ ed Open Source Community and the Um@@ es has already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertis@@ ers account for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertis@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , the company shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be updating its &quot; &quot; ad preferences &quot; &quot; tool in order to have more control over it targeted advertising . &quot;
Facebook announced on Thursday that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; said a Facebook actors in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss free@@ way over@@ ride
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police sum@@ mon@@ ed witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on to a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who prompt these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligent killing , after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and was unconscious in the streets , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere , could once have rejected similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ ents its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years , was subjected to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burnt away from the ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
during the summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations will have to be perfectly att@@ un@@ ed to the organisation . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the last season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens , and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles for the wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit down at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of processing of the current stri@@ fe , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks that will start early next year in order to re @-@ address the problems .
&quot; the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ cla@@ des in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating reduction follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods stand with the planet formation . &quot;
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
now you are turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars come out of great quantities of star winds . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars rotate slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , how , when and why stars de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League three times , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ olls , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games because of an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the chief suspect for years to receive performance @-@ promoting agents through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time swe@@ e@@ tish . &quot;
also his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have been playing the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and to the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a wis@@ er athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events took place in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runners in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven last Sunday , which is used as a mask for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample was si@@ ck@@ ened at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the banned substance should deal with the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v responded immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had forbidden the complete Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the runner @-@ up nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous trials in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was at the centre of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the Chinese Championships in 2014 , Sun was positively tested for the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ ah , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so Per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by malware security specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims were willingly offered the tari@@ ffs required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators are speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ listed falls significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most malaria programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks carried out alar@@ ming in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it sel@@ ectively searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop business activity completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ z@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the hack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot;
&quot; and when individuals are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware has been created by buying malware yourself , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ berries are then looking for further hack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is paid per infected host .
&quot; the criminals usually instruc@@ t the criminals to spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful reporting , the perpetr@@ ators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; according to the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the top falls off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; it is not only available with a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l in case of raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , make his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is well balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; during manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the smart speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection , and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when required . &quot;
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , navigation device integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable with dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff broke a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline never had to pay compensation for the man .
case of Disease : when the Organ@@ izer pays for
&quot; after their trip , ill holiday@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is doubt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a negotiated case , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Turkish lau@@ rel . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness returned the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not have any success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only informed about the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his obligations , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially in the samples of the water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with one another - belongs to the overall risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , this increases safety and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot;
promoting terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the right of arms to be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is ham@@ pered . &quot;
the last deal of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to further enhance security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed action .
&quot; this was an ear file for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality . &quot;
he considers the general ban of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to talk about rules , e.g. in road traffic , or for witnesses to court . &quot;
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating energy and capacity to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism packages .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junction
it takes a regular look at the circum@@ vent@@ ing road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal ab@@ duction is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who are standing in traffic on the road every night in traffic when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße from Wes@@ eler Straße up 700 meters .
mot@@ orists can then thread directly from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the great advantage : traffic is dividing up early , whereby the total of the passage is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road con@@ stri@@ ction on the feeder nerves makes mot@@ orists nervous especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the retreat extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ onian trail and sometimes beyond . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 , just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic will only be guided by lane across the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ assembled a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to include the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected factory daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ dation , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule school visited the theatre &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the prize @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the Young theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 pupils visited the production in the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , the press release of the Young theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without a refugee and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical discourse are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather gave the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ ckers in the southwest of Germany a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ den , which , with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour , are among the fastest star @-@ bu@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep much longer in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can cause various causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Beauty and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but what one understands first among them , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely the passage that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind it , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is common in a depression often , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it may be that different factors contribute to one another .
&quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worry , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; impairment can look quite different : tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ sensitive . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , under@@ lines Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , if you have problems with sleeping problems , you should contact the family doctor first , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with difficulty breathing , in case of ill day@@ time fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the covering , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping ends . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which you can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold at the short @-@ track championships in Doh@@ a for the first time and simultaneously exhibited his first record world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his former team @-@ mates via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic champion gets a bonus of € 20,000 and a jungle of € 150@@ ,000 no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming sports is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even operate on dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , he would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS can be controlled by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : gangs of baggage arrest arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civilians of the Düsseldorf Police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years old . &quot;
the susp@@ ects committed several hand@@ bags and baggage pil@@ es as gang .
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences and were particularly professional in doing so . &quot;
the specialists of the Criminal Police Association 34 can prove four actions to those who have been travelling to Germany for the purpose of com@@ mitting off@@ ences to Germany .
&quot; in doing so , they took over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between there is another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like that , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; going along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a beer shop . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , in particular , the Berlin interior Senator Henkel has spoken several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after evacu@@ ating the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on June 22 , the police pat@@ rol with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers retired under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who holds three children here , is mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wish mostly police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
&quot; the tren@@ ches , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ iers and their neighbours , apparently do not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including the entire Main@@ zer Road close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ers from all over the world over the past few years . residents from East Germany and former home occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on the raised slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were cast with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes like body violation are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the crimes is made up of material damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars do not give it any longer directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately pulled into the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important for her that the residents get back their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to take them away : through fac@@ eless re@@ constructions in former buildings , which supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot approve of violence and destruction . &quot;
but what to do if someone never hears someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of those who stum@@ ble over color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood to complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else interfer@@ ing with . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ghty wool @-@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than rather relying on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le believes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are great and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office of the municipality to the municipality and the job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it &apos;s not working that you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be consolidated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be erected in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be f@@ ished or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people must develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping here .
it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it is just about to take time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; however , there are also problem cases , says customers honest , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small congregation , like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve call . &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and will not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary citizens must look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is h@@ ein@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter searched
the police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
&quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and struck the bar@@ b@@ arians in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
the police used several tren@@ ches as well as a police helicopter for the investigation .
the flag was without success .
&quot; possibly the unknown , in fact , fell short of the apartment or when they fled . &quot;
