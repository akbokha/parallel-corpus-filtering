<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for some variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses recalled on their holidays, they hunted at the fast gallop home to feed the food."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career ended again."</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swore for photographic purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and therefore also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talents."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Master Seeger was admitted to the Hall of Fame of the German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giants, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the roman Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping riders Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP's trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential rankings are, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">Over the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the question small in doubt and warns against what the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he will massively return to regulations, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore taxes for the rich would be increased, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in order to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there might be partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-drive the coal mining industry in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas; he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment program and demands:" a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop in the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics believe him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each person has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a support for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the issue of women fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many are secretly stealing from seeing no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"those who believe that when they arrive in Germany, that end is irre, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the north of Munich are traumatised, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to talk openly about the experienced, because shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not know to help, more accommodation is needed for them, Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in housing of the Governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are in some common shelters floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or are accommodated together men and women, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">How very the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to authorize new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to take more action at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" "persistently quiet" "would have remained to problems, which caused the contract to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JSC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the Board of Directors has today set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating work combat measures beginning at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the BMA Assistance Doctor, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms, which were recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during sessions that took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared slippery, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report of the whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but were even improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing bad had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows pointed out that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time was burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations of senior officials were most serious, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he died last month with a failed coup d" état of almost his ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West because it looked at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued resentment of the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus for having called for support for elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described me," Alliance of outsiders. ""</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave its role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents met at the press conference saying that they hadn't even stripped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"now I am saying that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became head of the protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's close friends, working as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retired on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So lies the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - met great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - complaining post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings to the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing of the" "ceiling blower", "which is approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete galley in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the road."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a slope of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances, which the team worked, were tiny - on each side, they were only few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "Living" concept for the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann said:" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be used as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, as Bratmann said:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"no matter how viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is escalating."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not yet complete: since the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion is going to run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planned political spokeswoman Nicole Palm should be bought out of the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of the year, there will be deadlines in the Weststadt."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be found there back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West town is drastically increased, the goal of the so-called mixing is removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few parts of the city.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created at first for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many of the pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person restores each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who follows 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to" take 30 minutes to come from the sofa "and" to be active every day, "launched deaf ears, because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends in hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also murderers who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clutched on Thursday to the title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result from 62.198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalline Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles turnes on the Swedish bar during the Women's Summer Festival in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-campaign title and in total the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that have a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the women's individual campaigns at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - including her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium in which Boorman was trained became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture blurred."</seg>
<seg id="27">Fleshy beams and denturns - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she resumed with 15,433 on the brim-beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was one on it."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her final funeral - a pure formality - and tears flowed in bright shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old female captain, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her practice, she threw out kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious."</seg>
<seg id="33">"as for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:"</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, is read in the report."</seg>

<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is assumed that the suspects have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally echoing the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and toured America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will only have four turists in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics that can be maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to offer the municipalities aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering a more affordable and easy-to-reach gym training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors, who voted in favour of a vote, rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt's plans were revealed to introduce the Treaty by force and said that the NHS would be in a" "No Man's Land" "and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend packages, to improve the maintenance to non-recurring times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Assistance doctors announced last night in a message:" "assistance doctors have made serious concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat up the current maternity crisis and plan to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">"only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through talks, in the government, struggled to take part and sometimes silence on deafening silence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happened in a promise that Jeremy Hunt had done last month, that his door would always be open."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the vibration and address the concerns of assistance physicians."</seg>

<seg id="16">"over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the tutelage and the whistle-buzzing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility during training, additional training for those who return from a professional break, training cysts, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education holidays and the gender-specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture to bloom election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office due to corruption from office."</seg>
<seg id="3">A Political Correctness culture has led to knowingly ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral fraud because of" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a passport with them, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter must simply call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger if they give up their votes, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistle-blowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial ruin culture that goes along with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special selection court ruled that the reigning mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" cynically, "and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person chooses to be someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letterpress - in which the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the conduct of evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as evidence was made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Lebanese background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity in terms of ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to cleanse the system, including the ban that political activists are working on briefings to stop" "electoral reap." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has handed out her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit to applications for an automatic mail selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists are working on complete mailings and envelopes of mailings.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to shut off barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a change of law, which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Legislative Act 1983)."</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on photography in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to make sure that the staff enforce the rule that voters are going to the polling cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal found Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was pleaded guilty as a result of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the effective "check-ups" of the election registrations of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said:" "the judgment in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heritage as the mother of Parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and litteristic lex of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped off his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before printing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to take."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lick the flush-button of a pull toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings to railway stations to washing bones of toilets, the task was definitely put under one sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial sheet showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "that comes close to the worst thing I have rolled into a toilet.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the direction of the film added:" "let me say so - I've lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am happy that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of respondents associate lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">"a musical conquers Salzburg: the" West Side Story, "Leeuard Bernstein's masterpiece."</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a youth-mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchester directed by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel:" "this music is full of rhythm," "he enthuses."</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria."</seg>
<seg id="12">"she remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria is playing and dancing."</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>

<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli goes back to the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">"one sees it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!"</seg>

<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others, that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from the east of London went into an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the deceased Judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting Gary to choose" "Garland" "with a certain degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton as to whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't worry about restlessness with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="9">"RAID said Republicans who blocked the nomination of Garland, were minions and helpers from the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump."</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever doesn't suit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" a few hundred thousand, "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protesters from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president, Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with impunity already months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing from Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the shattered putsch, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">"many will want to start anew in Europe, if they are further suppressed in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes on refugees themselves, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been wiped out or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief of the association called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"also in Germany, there is a" witch-hunt "against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as Gülen trailers destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"anyone who doesn't suit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Foundation Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"on the reporting date June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum seekers (39.625)."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in this survey, there is no shortage of war, poverty or lack of prospects."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"what's more stupid than it hasn't been: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced of the electoral campaigners are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers traveling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't be allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are also practical problems: during the holidays helpers, the posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and at the end count out the votes, only laboriously apply."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just short of the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">How strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionality remains exciting.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from its big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as it did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame Merkel for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" We create, "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you are at the right place in the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to big documents; Merkel's parliamentary circle is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxonia than Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other German states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual polls on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, for instance, cools, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country, you are crumbling the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"like the left, the SPD, the Greens, you can hardly find it in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much of the game is at stake, Sellering now called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the emergency and move their election campaign largely into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign", "it calls the regional president Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green elective fighters embark on trace search for local voters among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvades with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from barriers</seg>
<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty much," Elvira Tetzlaff tells about the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the opposite is also commended for the construction of those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of expeditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site on Monday to the south is andered and the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passing traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says Florian King, vice director responsible for the management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachelsstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeks were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">This led to the fact that some trucks were franchised in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality demanded to strengthen the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute splashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue outbreaks in them, let anyone look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the end customer, so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decline," "but also admits that" "course of course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in terms of sales revenue, he estimates" far above 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Street refurbishment has been thrown back for two years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other districts where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars are seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"at the end of the renovation works, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, that's brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">Laws are constantly screwed in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick safety package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all of that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the sergeant.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overt anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, more outgoing points would initially be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, he was on the basis of results and at a" realisable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time left before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things have already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority is to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and truce law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière launches a second concentric run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and to push jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," "admits the CDU man."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and doesn't demand anything whatever the coalition partner has any chance anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans fast methods for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country are supposed to check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still work unchecked and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the attacks by Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people profoundly employed, did not let themselves be clinging to election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is greatly moved into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">"with regard to internal security, the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, the two parties went up high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a long argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy idea collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the Ressort chiefs also demand a burka ban and a return from dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">"de Maizière, too, is struggling for conciliatory sounds."</seg>
<seg id="39">He does not receive anything from a departure from the double-pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">"to re-establish, do not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a Burka ban, he has constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is unconstitutional in all corners and whether it is actually" "reasonable" "for the coalitionist, must first show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the SPD, however, is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of inner security."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Europe's largest car manufacturer can, despite its many brands and some well-running markets, offer a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China alone, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level."</seg>
<seg id="10">Deliveries increased by almost one sixth in the home market of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">"sales manager Jürgen Stackmann brought back the weaker figures from July, mainly to two sales days less in Europe."</seg>

<seg id="17">"from January to July, group sales director Fred Kappler continued to present a sales increase."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, worldwide 5,904 million."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software exhaust.</seg>

<seg id="23">"after the conversion, the car manufacturer issued a" guarantee "certificate, but I do not speak of a" guarantee "as it was called on Friday in corporate circles."</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason for this is legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models.</seg>

<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion, no deterioration will take place and all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary men of middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to overlook him under the pseudonym of NonAllemoning Men's Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reopening of sound plates is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more aware of their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stuffing wildly before I stop, keep my hands and say something different like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - still there are a handful of fantastic record specialty stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (Number of numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of numbers: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, who he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers assumed an impulse to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record shells, from objects that watch happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flirts from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month haven't listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I stumble through a pile of bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of numbers: three middle-aged men), has noticed a trophy aspect of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came up here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicality."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only slowly get in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teen age and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sextaut pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for several minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window-shop as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting of records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records..." "she drives off with a dearded sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to smuggle the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"however, considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research revealed that the results of Yougov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebees by record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by slabs, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing about middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also noted that the temporary shops and restaurants often offered accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"over 170,000 people have signed the petition to uphold the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the shape of the Fijis, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji distributed a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was caused by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago under Ryan they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to wonder and let the attacks bounce off GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if you were going to run in driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau stayed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a vice-president of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but Fiji just stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua took a touch down in the right-hand corner and it stood 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presses through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sea sulcus, whose fans cheeks, fleshed and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked in a crushing blow in the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more amazing gold than these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was there when they called for the second Olympics in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a benchmark."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unwritten use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more accessible than the trainer who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operated and that's what they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances the correct term is at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 foot at a time when they said some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-breaking morning to talk a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin worked for me.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "Stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we didn't look forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want a firework, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"she feels so much better," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" West German Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, free day issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissary Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG shift of 20 percent falls."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for Electricity Generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions trading system, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," stated IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further intensified, when the world's largest producer of producer China threw massive steel into the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel groups price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties on import stole show effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Association reported on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced amount went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp through her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in teacher training she finished music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors, from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures arise in the old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"due to lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-infected people entail long-standing events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on your own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz will advise you."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who sounds when a sound goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the suitable offer, seniors have several options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this is true of every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens-scree is different with the urgency of their desperation."</seg>

<seg id="11">"they were played for a small pack of little ones, taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more strongly excited kittens that were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">"despite the small sample, researchers keep their results meaningful."</seg>

<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe also Austrian citizens are affected, be still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, such as waste."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife district."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosions went up again, and another person was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the beach of Patong, popular among holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Revier of the Coastal Police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chomphe on the south-east coast, demanded several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"one goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express himself to possible motives, but probably it is the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai Media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurrection or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between the security forces and the Muslim populations, there will be no necessary travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits a great influence to the military in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stifle chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, will help itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"just a year ago, in Bangkok, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine had been killed by 20 people - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic Games or World Records decide the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Centre, the easily overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV images."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes walk in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "made fun of it."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle, did not play a role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to run alone in a run over 100 meters of Freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and never had a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the District Office of Kulmbach, undercover was established for these sewage systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as head of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt, a new calculation of the fees for sewage systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period were to be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the engravating fee increases by laying down relatively small facilities with a very small sewage plant, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the underlying calculation period in all three plants, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, considerable scope was incurred."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage in the wastewater facility in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be removed, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses were due to the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in this context, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewer systems, has been spared in the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the situation for the mentioned systems will remain precarious after the view of stone houses, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage treatment association could not be extended by these facilities because it is about deficits."</seg>

<seg id="2">"snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, it enables Snapchat to around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unflowered, property-revolving tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, snapchat filters have critiqued criticism in which they were accused of making the app Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and blackened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat tells that it would have turned off the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, was that the filter was" hurting and the least said unpleasant. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been moved to the decreasing extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - could tend to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">She said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the big part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="2">"United States Central Command's military personnel modified intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot, reported a review committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committees, Intelligence and Armed Forces Commites, reports about great discontent among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services, typically enjoyed by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drawn a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom member announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command heads changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigation continues."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the high-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," harmed the morals among analysts and "gave too little space for differing opinions." "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were received by Centcom Analyst's complaints."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the inspectors of the General Inspector were still in progress."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts at times have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had been put into service to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger Command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature due to his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember it ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they ended up in the past London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work desk in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder out completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament to be the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro always feel constant and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queues without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could certainly have been among these known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline was already an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years were so sparsely perceived that many people I had asked didn't know that it was an olympic event at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"even though the US sent athletes to a competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending impact, but also the Grazie of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists need to go further up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes towards the finish, at the top and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also a further high goal in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic sea."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even whisper a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as being a bit tired even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13: 00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a secondary block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objtification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to breathe."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia impelled the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shattered the country and expanded more and more territories."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed in tens of thousands of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the videos circulating on the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how safety officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader in the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been more or less forced to exploit the turbulence and to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of exposure to the surface now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"until his death, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemaram Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil in 2005 after thousands of protests protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharan city, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for droning flights over neighboring Somalia, although it was recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama have founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate if he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump broke down with regard to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation perfectly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism leashes Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared" "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, who observed the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to vaguely keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corroborated tone, as its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump tries to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumpet has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trumpet, gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumpet's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbiters, completely false, and so it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing them to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand and say," You can't. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumpet's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="7">"but if New York is changing, it is also new invention."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">"there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu, and there are garnishes such as capers and sauerkraut."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural teardrops.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee cup for a while, she said."</seg>

<seg id="32">"I came fourth to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">"nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment over the fact that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for Verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go to their offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional Polish inhabitants, Greenpoints, have also accepted the café."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt has a passion for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" Chop Suey "dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "appearing on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, quick snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick kiln, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacked, this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Brickman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cream and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap prepared by the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-in-can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the ways in which the country moved with it, no longer to be the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," Coe said why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new BudgetDiet was equally tense: mysterious food such as breads and dasserole were added to staple foods, the casserolle as a" wonderful way to recycle food leftovers, "as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper drying fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tried out because a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction has primacy over taste or even a healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the utility recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - became the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household leaders, "and the challenge to transform pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic treats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandsharks will only receive up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-meter-long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate by a Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," commented Alexander Scheuereck from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span that for vertebrates means a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland haie will be stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is difficult to observe, after all, they mainly live in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her slow motion was measured by her, when she held six animals with a transmitter from Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the polar sea and search for cadaver that torches from higher layers of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a conspicuous carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons-seeking greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-watch showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland shark females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold to become sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the multiplication obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on flame-flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources rather into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministries from the pastoral care unit Eyeial-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day Pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages have been met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next migration of all miniregistrants in two years, the senior management round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various shrines were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's goal was given to the open portal of mercy at Freiburg Cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt, went on their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening, Pastor Storno sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and told the pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrim path started from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse, with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis made up to field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from specially composed pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish church of the local parishes was available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys' withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retires created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindu, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner set an olympic record in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindu went in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed to the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up a world record and defeated the world champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenny and Hoys page, Hindu stated that he intentionally descended on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindi said," "It feels with all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day were also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels quite lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the target in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had disputed before the qualification as officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly remarkable presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the middle of sex and mobbing accusations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if one looks at the first evening of competition in the bicycle, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of Portland melting due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy fixed for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt is about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Schmelzerei from Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, last, due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL said that the value of contracts was already written down in his annual depreciation of $187 million in" "expectation of termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the melt. ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still a statement guilty of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of electricity per year to consume about 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scaled reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is the cliché action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you? ", with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she and her husband Kanye West were in April 2014, but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that rather resembles a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine went through even before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, which are "modeled" as "models, the celebrities" on the cover. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years in her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mistletoes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were once again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it wasn't good in the hand either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite knocking."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the beginning, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which today would range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 communicator "arrived just 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"twenty years ago, however, communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover as an "West pocket format office."</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible by HTML-browser, albeit tormenting slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns' mobile phones experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and handled."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market is dominating suppliers that all came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is for very many people everyday."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world."</seg>
<seg id="27">"some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in community growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympian spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturers, companies who earn money with online advertising make attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect which part of the advertising page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her-Her-Fight Between the Closed Open Source Community and the Umes has already been underway since the invention of display blockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers, almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertisers account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertisers."</seg>

<seg id="11">Advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would be updating its" "ad preferences" "tool in order to have more control over it targeted advertising."</seg>
<seg id="13">Facebook announced on Thursday that Adblocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the police summoned witnesses, after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on to a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway."</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overdriven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who prompt these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing, after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could once have rejected similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exponents its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years, was subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burnt away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster to different rates, and in what context the rotational periods stand with the planet formation."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>

<seg id="7">Now you are turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these mature stars come out of great quantities of star winds."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by malware security specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willingly offered the tariffs required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are specializing in attacks in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be blacklisted falls significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Klecznski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most malaria programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks carried out alarming in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it selectively searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims:" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "explains Klecznski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and when individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware has been created by buying malware yourself, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the top of the top falls off."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only available with a luggage compartment of 453 l in case of raised back rests and 1026 l, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height is 650 mm higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he should, however, make his work somewhat quieter."</seg>

<seg id="17">But steering is likely to be a bit more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" during manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and the smart speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection, and throttles the speed when required."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, navigation device integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket lie underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep much longer in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can cause various causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but what one understands first among them, however, is the insomnia, that is, a sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is precisely the passage that many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found behind it, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common in a depression often," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors contribute to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worry, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day, go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - insensitive."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, underlines Prof. Ingo Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, if you have problems with sleeping problems, you should contact the family doctor first, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors, for example, in snoring with difficulty breathing, in case of ill daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the covering, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping ends."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between there is another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that, but the police count them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"going along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a fresched kindergarten and a beer shop."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created by 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy district" "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, in particular, the Berlin interior Senator Henkel has spoken several times for a tough action of the police against the project, the area called" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after evacuating the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrol with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the meantime, the building workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home owners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers retired under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who holds three children here, is mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wish mostly police protection from vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trenches, which the Berlin internal senator and the police between the occupiers and their neighbours, apparently do not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including the entire Mainzer Road close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pollers from all over the world over the past few years. residents from East Germany and former home occupiers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the raised slices or freshly painted facades that were cast with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often as "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes like body violation are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the crimes is made up of material damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"when it comes to violence, it is weightlifting: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars do not give it any longer directly in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately pulled into the Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important for her that the residents get back their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to take them away: through faceless reconstructions in former buildings, which suppress the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve of violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never hears someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of those who stumble over color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood.</seg>

<seg id="9">"an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle believes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office of the municipality to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it's not working that you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings need to be consolidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be erected in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be fished or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People must develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it is just about to take time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, may not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there are also problem cases, says customers honest," people with nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small congregation, like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," "what some naive call." "a residual risk could and will not exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Client."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary citizens must look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is heinous."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
