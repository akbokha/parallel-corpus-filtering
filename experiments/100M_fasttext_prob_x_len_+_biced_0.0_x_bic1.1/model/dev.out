Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution being discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal , promoted by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor wants to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a slightly z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably ag@@ itated , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ ble on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had done the fat@@ eful call at some point after that .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; he himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attending courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave a complaint for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the congregation on a candle light memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial watch , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace were sung . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Writ@@ ers E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress calls Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season staff like last year , but toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , sell , and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated har@@ dening and a mes@@ ial length of being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ trip movie ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the peripher@@ y of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot;
&quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in overcoming the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys down@@ wards , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ ump &apos;s stamina and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
&quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot;
&quot; now , six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans claimed they were either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten would say they were &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ ump &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ et state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters are getting used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their funds , repub@@ lican voters hold tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten at the end of July set their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it is apparent that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters reject Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is disper@@ sed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now about half the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anger . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , there is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a homeless house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; means the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular locations , one square meter costs the most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential sites , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nix - per square meter , well @-@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot;
by the way : Munich is not at the head here as an exception .
Champions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double pi@@ per in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their playing game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller received good assistance from Olympic champi@@ ons @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a f@@ lange thought out of the World Champion at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bayern @-@ leadership . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich spoke . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his recent six home games in the league , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but often in@@ ventive with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed by the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion missed the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by appointment the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee par@@ ked ( 35@@ th ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians have used their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; but Manuel Neu@@ er , keeper of the door , was missing . &quot;
&quot; for instance , when he had a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ wards ( 57 . ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain link with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Mu@@ eller still sat on it . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was in the stadium to craw@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after a small group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; good news : when doing so , the risk will drop quickly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers were able to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the risk of 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ine inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Boeing &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of in@@ fertility have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study highlights the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble across the Rhein@@ u@@ fer from the late antique period
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a department for archaeological heritage conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found a fifth . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , described Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , which belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman from freight train recorded
&quot; after a young woman is unhappy at the train station in the ho@@ stages , the Federal Police asks the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station towards the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , it was severely injured by the assessment of the train . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue services .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence for the agents who are mi@@ dd@@ le@@ men . &quot;
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private mediation facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , at the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by means of TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceeding are specifically envis@@ aged that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow obj@@ ections against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice have not trusted , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to their own data on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for instance , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , through which companies can take compensation from tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all for the fact that they are not supposed to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German State Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance . &quot;
&quot; during the Reform , the Commission considered essential points that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy @-@ acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they emerged and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative person . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; published and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; smart composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be said in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , already &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks positive some expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician returns to the series living in New York . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , 2005 is a polished masterpiece . &quot;
over@@ bor@@ n@@ ingly reminiscent of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ brow@@ band and big fluorescent stage de@@ ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg city of Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the stri@@ dent St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; sla@@ b &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself only to an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually tends to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture is eag@@ erly awaited &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is said to have made his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment and for the first time set himself up with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the commem@@ oration of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several song @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to present Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; is that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , across the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy set says that he has given &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subject to both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ tain@@ ers and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle will be represented by the shadow of economic governance if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch P@@ unch Theatre . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and his position among his Par@@ liam@@ entary colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds In@@ cre@@ ases by Acc@@ eler@@ ated Growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period last year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est estimates since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after receipt of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ sch together . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the stocks of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold Sach@@ s his assessment of the rating for the company R@@ ating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports service company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the capital : on the Bi@@ eber expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a hand@@ shake with an upper FR@@ IS@@ E . &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; this is where her i@@ dol is living here , whose posters hang on in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her dream . &quot;
compulsory school attendance ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber itself does not .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertising in the super@@ star &apos;s advertising break , he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples firm donated many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll , which looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is just in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? , &quot; No. 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the Kartoffel@@ keller , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay m@@ ashed potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer spaw@@ ns in his store , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea was to let the Lebanese know in the meantime at the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealer and supplier jump aboard , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell endor@@ sed tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries for twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million per year and cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that , next year , Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million US $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market share in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in revenue and margins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programmes are to grow at El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior in the view of the president of the Australian Tennis League Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the lim@@ eli@@ ght with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s in@@ famous dispute with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . Har@@ rison had to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I am quite en@@ vious is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been dra@@ gged into the stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we want the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the lim@@ eli@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary decl@@ ines emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indignation . &quot;
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some of them returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister stated that it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block in a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not abandon his hopes for a soon @-@ coming action from Brussels or from his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , which was held on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and ha@@ sten asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , became a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government states the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities made 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot;
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd in order to ins@@ ure themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they entered Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit gain in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders did some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
their support for the men has dropped significantly and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the pre @-@ elections nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would love them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters are saying this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ gesti@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president casts a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half say that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly to the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries is unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in elec@@ ting the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot;
&quot; multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and endow@@ ed with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best off with hon@@ esty , while clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; answering questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public all in all .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for her among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote now also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump scores good marks for leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters &quot; support is eliminated in the new survey , and others lose their support dramatically . &quot;
the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the most ind@@ ented , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor of Florida J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place at 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son goes to the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people are no longer going to the sea : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of Bar@@ uch College Neul@@ ings
&quot; after a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , almost two years after a student died , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood gri@@ eved Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally in September 2013 and delayed his transfer to the hospital that contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with frau@@ ght eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the Emer@@ gency Number 911 after Den@@ g became power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; &quot; said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide tools and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge due to murder of the third count for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of serious attacks and formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also punish them , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local community . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest rate rise , and the house se will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance for the business process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal al@@ ti@@ tudes , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a view based on historical trends how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the past month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is mostly upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the cre@@ asing cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that were not before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
most not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question as to whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took up the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all cre@@ asing cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights are quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in the case of bonds , returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cre@@ asing cycle , the loans drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed is tigh@@ tening its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and entire , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average rate of 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns as well as lower volati@@ lity in their shares exceeded the average rate of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) on average .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers can see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; says a leading Euro MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives , MEP Andrew B@@ ingham , also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just another name for The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC Director General dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works to me is really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder work has to be done to engage audiences as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , fell under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , &quot; &quot; He wants the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; , &quot; when the next time we start a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money by the fee counter for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the record began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down the expenditure in November
virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled for over a decade and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
&quot; however , experts say that there are indications now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started working with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is decreasing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers jumped around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the purch@@ as@@ ers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could stop shop@@ pers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spent on a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chain in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first burial sites in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia laying down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane was collap@@ sing on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ z@@ ha .
&quot; mour@@ ners filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to pay tribute when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ist@@ ani cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane reached the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the worshi@@ ppers collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed down a san@@ ction on the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators killed , when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was standing . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Grand Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mek@@ ka with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , would not have let the arm of the crane stand before it was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane coming into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who is taking place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded get half of this amount .

&quot; Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at tra@@ des@@ men , are opened . &quot;

&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who perform work in their homes
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , has now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and 60 selling points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we must move this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on purchasing articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women listed at the top of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Regional Court two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 had funds from club accounts to disp@@ ose of them in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; at around 400@@ ,000 euros , he counts the damage . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial errors .
&quot; this fact divided the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen to the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials only charged extra expenses and the sports club , for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , came out of the debt - the Passi@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we faced the situation : do we carry the club further or block us ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told us , in the bread@@ vocation of the finance office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies went down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the confis@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debts can be made . &quot;
&quot; in the case of financial success , the pa@@ yout of the expenses of the allowance was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid years later , namely since 2003 when a plus had been on the bank account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , l@@ ump sum and not detail bookings seemed to appear , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and pass@@ books were administered jointly by the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als had not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for financial support , it was important that only the freedom of debt would have been the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; the defend@@ ants , who had been set@@ backs , declared . &quot;
&quot; this security account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dents did not know for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor did in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years could not demonstrate the defend@@ ants .
&quot; after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they were no longer kept , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
&quot; all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , in order to have to drive the international market to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard presents another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reductions that have been running for three years , the computer will disman@@ tle other jobs during the company spl@@ itting up . &quot;
the positions at the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to € 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; in retro@@ sp@@ ect , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share delivered 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Califor@@ nian company , Pal@@ o Alto , is currently divided into a new company : the computer and print shop will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales as well as a weaker demand for company customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man only lately re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly result in rejection : 54 percent spoke out against it , 35 percent expressed approval . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; 24 percent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian government Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed refuse to be 20 percent . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
&quot; the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility until 27 September . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violent erup@@ tion at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; on the Serbian border , the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ wers against several hundred refugees . &quot;
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind that , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a jet@@ fighter stood ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
&quot; at first , the officers constantly put pe@@ pper@@ y spray . &quot;
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was bre@@ wed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit .
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered severe short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US emergency bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed would do this now , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will last . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate has been placed on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death squ@@ ad at Delta State University left ap@@ ology for ap@@ ology
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not do it , &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , He has shot on a man , and a man killed . &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , the 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University , as his CV was on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around the world
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
&quot; the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone , with a better organisation . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business anymore in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the Ro@@ of of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot cleaning cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stri@@ cken strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come to yield viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the pilot &apos;s transition supply , background is the wings concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competi@@ tor routes , Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this made the left external defender to cry and won him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season again . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was inj@@ ected into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg structure and is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the def@@ enders of England have an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad at that . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a child@@ care provider to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 , was chosen by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a news on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead gives a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street speaker said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ cre@@ tes from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned with results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss blessed his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England initially set aside Jonathan in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a hit man I treasure .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowling and would get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I did nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ porters at once and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him , he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there are no large numbers of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer &apos;s staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said ones . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the timet@@ able . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made of light hearts .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ checked new negotiation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently diver@@ ted itself to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes , which they usually do not want , are satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exagger@@ ated long endur@@ es like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will rip a leg to help the British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan some helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , but which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gues , phone @-@ he@@ aders and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having dinner and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the EU &apos;s un@@ approved constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind rap@@ es@@ eed on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and wild slopes of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ - Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking occurred from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing public health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis , &quot; on which P@@ he justified his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead to their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it was supposed to have received from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the board members are not supplied , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes include some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the P@@ he tobacco line .
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally ad@@ mits &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage to most products in most of the criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acting to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by giving up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national competence . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders says former leader of Channel 4
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK tran@@ smit@@ ters .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programmes , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in highly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and other broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent that would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I think is not for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least concentrate its production on programs that others do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme that could be financed even without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am eager to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault at hunting for reviews was &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broadcast shows again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ day@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders to sell shows . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion broadcast charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; of course , you all think , we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Hit@@ tite mission , &quot; to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled from out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to support the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student homes
&quot; eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ catching to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , where and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people get dressed and put their under@@ wear on their way . &quot;
related to : do not forget to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences make up a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos Lo@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student homes had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to introduce oneself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to bake for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with this more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it matters to them to make Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a trial in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she dropped her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour exam . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , reti@@ re and see them every day , and perhaps witness how they out@@ run all common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your lower abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stone is funny , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give you a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security by hiding - but never mind someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which will then put you in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , singles , ger@@ und servic@@ er &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner ental row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the poor servant . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old is in an interview with the 44 @-@ year @-@ old .
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass storage in containers or gymnas@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people stay here for a great deal .
&quot; in view of the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are taught in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have passed my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth Sonder@@ bau and the Stell@@ platz@@ Reg@@ ulations .
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
&quot; it is still under@@ represented , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how have the residents re@@ acted to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor servant . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ priced today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or trying to upgrade via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by linking the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may be switched on half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup second under@@ lined the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I didn &apos;t lose anything anymore . &quot;
53 points split the world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ time champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far and also attacked the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smoke in the city state will affect Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a bell bell hangs above the city , caused by fires on the neighbouring island Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate play@@ - and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that the chairman Alfred Klein took .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search shall also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft joined the social foundation under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the inner city .
&quot; more specifically , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square . &quot;
a new district office recently opened .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the nursing and nursing staff . &quot;
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often caring relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new house@@ wife Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and . &quot;
&quot; apart from consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally comple@@ menting each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association with the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular soci@@ alizing . &quot;
the social foundation thus gives a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 am to 12 noon . &quot;

&quot; in the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg moved through victories in the district limit of 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the region@@ al@@ gi@@ sts 1 . FC Schwein@@ furt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday . &quot;
M@@ ang gives the Künstler@@ haus an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna . &quot;
&quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but he also worked as a teacher , writer and director . &quot;
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and to renov@@ ate the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the last two years .
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not oppose it . &quot;
&quot; a meadow was straight in the inner city of Bremen , when he saw how outside a parking atten@@ dant presented a bal@@ lot for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , meadow stor@@ med out of the shop , insul@@ ted the cler@@ k and threw her the fine fin@@ es in front of the feet , as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper reports . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the alle@@ gations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only afterwards I will decide whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men beat 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a head@@ stick , one checked on the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , there is only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ers to contact the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and investing 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eh@@ ausen .
&quot; also the joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ eh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ eh@@ aus@@ ens met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently has completed her professional training at the dener Hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon . &quot;
&quot; and so one agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice . &quot;
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medicine studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed leading veter@@ in@@ arian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from the 19th of September , the practice is being prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ eh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EC@@ Gs and need a chat room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 Euros will be donated to the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding programme from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues , &quot; emphas@@ ises joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ eh@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone too . &quot;
those who visit Müll@@ ers Consul@@ tation also continue to look above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the field work .
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eh@@ ausen , smiling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients as often as possible , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself in front of gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can &quot; of course &quot; do this . &quot;
the care and safety of the people is par@@ amount .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to incoming refugees towards Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration in Eastern Croatia . &quot;
the c@@ roati@@ an police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country has around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ted to Croatia , coinci@@ ding Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was necessary to persu@@ ade people to adopt specific routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away , through Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ lying route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report concerning the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be about very high numbers of refugees at present .
&quot; it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
foreign exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians are paying 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of providing insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der transactions should have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused were di@@ gest@@ ed in the case .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the USA and from Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lot of bu@@ oy@@ ant operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their err@@ ands , sometimes quick steps , sometimes cozy bum@@ per . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban gu@@ ide@@ ways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ uri@@ ous life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the midst of it four large boards each with the heading &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce responded with this action to its 20th anniversary and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffering &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , how to deal with the dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; but it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people . &quot;
an estimate that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the dying and mourning @-@ atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid by calling volunteer officials , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
all are meti@@ cul@@ ously trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle his task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ time , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the dying and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his earnings prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower prospect comes in spite of price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging of heavy and large packages starting in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; gains solid income if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra labor , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which were predicted twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the acks questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a drop in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its Un@@ ity Express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days of this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping the US Employment and Prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . on Thursday , it is announced whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and even if it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an interest increase this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mil@@ der the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy susta@@ ins the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ella said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % lower than May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred in the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; con@@ strict &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they do not only super@@ v@@ ise developments elsewhere , but are also consul@@ ted with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates interest rate increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia has led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to go into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
a warm welcome to prepare is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in asylum seekers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is quite different lessons than at a real school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clarify women in a sho@@ cking manner , how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around on Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent joint session , the completed building application was unanim@@ ously approved without big discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee had decided to apply for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; wai@@ ver &quot; of the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; it went again to the roof ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan is not allowed to &quot; exceptions &quot; regarding the annex@@ ation of the roof , and the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council usually de@@ parts restric@@ tively in the case of deliver@@ ance orders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project for gymnas@@ tics : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; in the next stage of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the District Office for the examination . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg leads to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further In@@ ner ward to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot travel to Sch@@ on@@ gau , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared himself ready to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; in any case , for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this meant &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fis@@ her@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in future . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity arises not again , &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the manus@@ cripts of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason to be arrogan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener referred to the Bh@@ c a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ al with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a cor@@ n@@ field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police informed . &quot;
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the crime police were investigating .
missing 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 year old missing 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police told on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was indic@@ ted according to the fact that he was indic@@ ted and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse , is also deemed to be a suspect . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially launched personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the ceremony was reported in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay dead on him . &quot;
the investigation into the immediate circumstances is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable residence .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have been living in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a new housing deficit , which is increased from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently around 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many professionals were living in large cities in room @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the exposure to the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has sun@@ k for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; this way , the tax reb@@ ate tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to temporary exposure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the announcement of the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reports . &quot;
&quot; on the day of the day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new laws that came into force the same day , moreover , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports are Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Ser@@ b border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a border fence . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before closing on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
convic@@ ted threaten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 refugee applications were accepted on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has any more prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers have begun to clean up . &quot;
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier rails have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only reaching a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to the government &apos;s declarations . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the on@@ ward journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor passed over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u by train . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly hired railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bri@@ des along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once in a while , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to receive a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the train passengers were switched to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u in order to try it after the short @-@ term announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still on the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on the day before a two @-@ leg movement athletic - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in order to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor pointed out highly official and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; the P@@ oultry will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ y lod@@ gings &quot;
&quot; with the off@@ shoot of refugees , Konrad decided to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen site .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial experts , he has already conducted talks . &quot;
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the Asyl@@ um Co @-@ ordin@@ ator sets great expectations also in the ORF &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped for hotels that stand empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that the employers had to comply with a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in the accommodation , he reas@@ oned with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to cost , as they stated themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , your own source search hasn &apos;t been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , additional locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism is exer@@ ted by the governor on the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action on Monday in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be shut off .
the continuation of refugees into the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special moves with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria is also a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is entered , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) will be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - which is what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
&quot; in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ ar@@ cade , the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to post@@ p@@ one this project : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop selling bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long considered whether I want to open another shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
Br@@ eit gave her fashion interest in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I feel the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used to enhance any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
some people also connect this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office sp@@ ins the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ onic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire are coming from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair@@ cut is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village are related to him via -@@ zig corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt nature , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he hasn &apos;t brought it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the investors , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the investors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home dur@@ ably , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the movie . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ent .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born trou@@ gh , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; &quot; he is always so start@@ ling . &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t win the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ho@@ und Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie @-@ go@@ ers , also in the US aw@@ akes the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the ratings for Today . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the board seemed not to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August , today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 flow@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the grand news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ er@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers , beating the Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe posted an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot water average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute which didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If you are not , who should win W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; their answers could become a cor@@ rup@@ a who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made it clear last week that Wood was &quot; one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an angel as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ mas@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
he also publicly supported Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a passport was leading to a t@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee figures , the Free voters are calling for the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as she gave during the Yugoslavia Wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free elec@@ torate as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot;
but the regional policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting tor@@ rent remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 grammar schools , in which an extension of the secondary school secondary stage is tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that we want .
&quot; free travel at the G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is requested . &quot;
celeb@@ r@@ ity Wall Street helps Da@@ x jumps on the jumps
&quot; the German stock market has closed , after a long @-@ distance , direction @-@ less and nervous trading history with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
Tec@@ Da@@ x &apos;s technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; according to Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , the euro zone &apos;s body index dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also lost trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index posted some 1 percent in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many stock@@ holders reck@@ on that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the U.S. and also to the big fall of the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , leaving deep marks on E@@ on as well . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government has denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Da@@ x , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; looked after the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market . &quot;
&quot; auto values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were re @-@ set than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA launched at the start of the IA@@ A International Motor Show in Frankfurt . &quot;
car manufacturers Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers rose by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets declined by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock of listed German securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the pension index Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the price of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar therefore cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ stretch district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are still some concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den city plans to market a plot of approximately 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and housing . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor interest is still not clear yet .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Road , already a few months ago and the buildings on it were torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some of the residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure time
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , medium @-@ sized Em@@ press Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council &apos;s municipal development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , accused of investors and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ ly went from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in the discussion for some ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building , caused by violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea bree@@ der and member of the board representing the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ c@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this will be a giant ring overlooking all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come in order for that to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens exactly on the estate of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches Double Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to help raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees over@@ roll the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / stat@@ er@@ eli@@ ef to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also fled the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya devast@@ ated by the war . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ub formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; in the meantime , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes care approximately the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgery , 36 % of the diabetes worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes has only been reduced by one percent and partly in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for persons interested in a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is currently attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hands disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swallow up strong alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres reported , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said some children dis@@ infection agents drink pur@@ pos@@ efully while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mutation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ urs from straw@@ berry scent @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is deemed to be drunk in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words , and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors over@@ took them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; gem@@ eine &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; the police examined the sh@@ ei@@ d plan as &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ witz &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers center player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Celtic fighting , but the Norwegian leader s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was defeated , who now stand at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this just like that - but we have to continue .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
getting together is so important .

&quot; players who come in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as showed the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland declined to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; whoever is chosen , will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she acknowledged that she &quot; &quot; could have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he &apos;d do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man named after moist police persecution hunt to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspiring locals were inspired by the humor@@ ously planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had been held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to be &quot; looked like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be any more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before that , M@@ oo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call if I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the coach have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ folded master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and following driver flight in Cob@@ ash@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;
the police said that the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and absen@@ ces for assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ urg , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against Riv@@ ales due to claims on Ring@@ struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ire judges allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying final on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ er@@ g of his team , and said that at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team viol@@ ates him confi@@ dently , as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this repeatedly appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
&quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out , that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not have any points of tension ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will arrive at them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has released this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man , who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that could have been in the café for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ent declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he dis@@ covers his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tear@@ ing apart
&quot; in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police informed . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ tor completely stri@@ pped apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from 6 hours to 2 pm .
&quot; the result was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg received the girl &apos;s phone when she slept and logged in to an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction -- that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was done by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ lic . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and weeping .
she then also saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions on 25 January and did not appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; was found in his disappearance . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other cases pending . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
slu@@ dge devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers caused fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
&quot; there , they are taken into reception by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police Head@@ quarters , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 o &apos;clock alone , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the south @-@ west &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm marine air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the ground with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : roughly 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations were accounted for by the German Transport Agency ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Pub@@ um@@ days September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by the dealers in the fall . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , with a view starting at 17@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door model . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A on new compact cars ?
Renault Meri@@ an : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; he enters trade early next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan ou@@ trigger wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts fully to the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions in 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n remo@@ ver presented above all hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed above all , reduced the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to narrow spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a solitary confin@@ ement facility in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , was moved into a larger cell . &quot;
his ar@@ rests because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdict of the Higher Regional Court in Berlin and transferred the case to re@@ trial . &quot;
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , a wor@@ sen of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human dignity is also the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , in addition to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , also confirmed that a decent housing was att@@ ested to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fights , because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young lack of talent , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will be able to take up a million refugees according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price per year , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be created per year and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agreed that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , critici@@ zes the refugees in Germany at all in order to help them get started . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ot@@ er@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was earlier a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence obligation , the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view is mostly enforced by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is still no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg &apos;s view of the integration of work . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ eing parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ z@@ abel , spokesperson for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages . &quot;
&quot; should the demand for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared in welcome classes on the lessons . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones@@ from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle no federal land of asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude . &quot;
student willing refugees could become easier access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a refund or tolerance do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law , if they start their studies . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of bearer @-@ authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; the foundation of an Islamic well @-@ being association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important . &quot;
duties include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain controls . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take a heart attack against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole of society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination act and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany undertake , must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected until now , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding power and capacity , we are creating that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for health cards to be handed over to all descendants . &quot;
achievements could be expected later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cast down so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers act of asylum . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier especially possible . &quot;
&quot; even so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are becoming more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in hospitals , but also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , translation costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; many refugees , however , would have helped many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated han@@ di@@ caps , and with the young people it is about people living with HIV . &quot;
&quot; with some other diseases German doctors come from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , and some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly again take ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study published by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from amongst others the so @-@ called flas@@ ho@@ sters with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can make an application for a psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick and was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to lovers is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; manager Reinhard Pro@@ bst , Managing Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , describes his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the barely 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take up loose . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ vas , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ cle@@ ousness . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ People fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and is fascinated by their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t care well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from their eyes every request . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; from 17 to 20 September , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe leads the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also am@@ assed by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with repentance .
&quot; last month , they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that immunity ends in the Parliament , and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and in @-@ depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement by the company . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and provided that his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , its participation in the next summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsenal is that it has been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a prone period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta could start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by the far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to that in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open oneself is now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends first so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments while watching football in cozy sessions and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide really showed me clearly how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to crush the Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will join PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as they asp@@ ire not only to qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing door was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he shut down to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone thought that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only p@@ opped in the first half in the first half and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the H@@ ours mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth place after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion US $ by share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is headquartered in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars by a stock sales on Wednesday as part of his huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
&quot; registered in London , Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it has sold new shares in the value of about 1.6 billion £ to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issu@@ ance of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of London &apos;s stock exchange trading on early Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
&quot; the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns about a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to the FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion world champion , twice champion champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time , Madrid simply won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Munich . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship .
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown , when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the filling of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with off@@ beat un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian re@@ affir@@ med . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ iny beaten by her white hal@@ ves . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince gave a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still weaker , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media outlets , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which completed her 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope was in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the vic@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it gets the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
&quot; America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon uph@@ eld his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to concentrate fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle her@@ on on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three rounds at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who vent@@ ures a two @-@ run get@@ away to the right @-@ h@@ anders Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the injury list before the game had been missing more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ einer gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he hasn &apos;t beaten well , but he has caught the right spot . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count and scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever left @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A.@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder tie , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20th .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian capital city were prepared for this fall in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there . &quot;
they should then be distributed to other local communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the ruling presi@@ dium responsible for the initial tak@@ eover , some 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think that the decisive reflection on military action must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; collective expul@@ sion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military involvement has passed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict comes crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees . &quot;
Austria controlled at Southern and Eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria has again set up controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ caster ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
also Germany sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call it concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection , they too . &quot;
&quot; but if you do not have a lead eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort of force . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
&quot; on Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania would cruci@@ fy with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from crossing Romania and Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the proposed new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to witnesses , thousands of other migrants reported on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ nat@@ ches . &quot;
this is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planet . &quot;
&quot; although this movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us .
it was known for some time that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ic@@ volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 for several weeks
&quot; the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offensive player , for about one month . &quot;
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an examination .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented initially a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove its ability . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training once more . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a grave bl@@ ur . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus supports visual power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and smell pleasantly . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then they taste pure , of course , or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot;
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US package service U@@ PS provides up to 9@@ 5000 help for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 assi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making provisions since last year to be prepared for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had made harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first round tower , then prominent cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night falls in the valleys of the mountain hut of F@@ öhn through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the breeding @-@ valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings powerful rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain side , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h on Thursday morning , isolated and partly also partly with over 100 km / h especially in the canton of Ur@@ ner@@ land . &quot;
&quot; in some places , the hair @-@ dryer can reach into the adjoining centre and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the hill@@ side . &quot;
&quot; this is where rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , in the south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square metre must be calculated in the next 48 hours , which has already fallen into large amounts of rain in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n will leave the air , as a result a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , on Wednesday a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city as a rotten sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions should have encouraged him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt drew for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into current contexts into &quot; &quot; today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing took place with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up this , perhaps to be reconc@@ iled to the Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern was to revi@@ ve art again in a quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertisement today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the images &quot; &quot; to let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost visited Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
&quot; I did not pay attention to fully capture the Bible , but also selected the subjects that were important to him , including mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text simply explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway approaches
&quot; plans made , location found , company mand@@ ated , ground hills mod@@ elled for a round course : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hills de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the first community partner Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to report now in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further remembrance &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its engagement for refugees up to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am going to the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday , and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and will help .
but the crucial course must be the policy .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will be showing a clear sign when they will be wearing the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Peter Ret@@ tig , managing director of H@@ offen@@ heim , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale , Germany . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the German Research Foundation ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already accessed the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
&quot; according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after midnight on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ died , fa@@ inted , got out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to stand up once you have fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered injuries when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he is therefore just as spar@@ ed as a spare @-@ driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only alter its parent &apos;s position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keepers position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Roman br@@ ush@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe @-@ League matches , Tu@@ sali@@ va was open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final move for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , aver@@ aged mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl in comprehensible manner : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together at the IA@@ A with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the strategy paper by the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy change@@ over to digital radio radio .
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid additional liability risks to the driver , the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see themselves scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ative organization Dek@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will succeed in the coming ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the U.S. 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least represent 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to beat only in singles , from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to that , &quot; said the fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has taken a serious injury to the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit with a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis indicated the 20 @-@ year @-@ old player from Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ eer on a sh@@ ale leg .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits became the big star of fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not built chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk that was used for a lot of effort : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers arrived in Munich 14 tons of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ingly modified side@@ ways of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
his parents had not allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went on the long embroi@@ dery machine in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make metres . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion store . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace , fashion played a bigger role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ tian industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing job potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is made much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , currently in Russia and in the USA . &quot;
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also seeks to focus on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been running a seal of quality , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor office of Z@@ wick@@ au University of Technology - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly different in order to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine picks up small glob@@ ules at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; previously , I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en Peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to adopt a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ adaptation , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical girl @-@ girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already strong : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group t@@ asked with the governance of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should work to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; boo@@ sting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management board has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local currency system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also take control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow bor@@ der@@ lands to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and simpli@@ fying the application process . &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
&quot; at the meeting Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double its mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby lead consumers to a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot;
&quot; consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and adverse events failed industrial and environmental policy with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in return for this e@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is widely spread over the food chain in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on his homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the inc@@ iner@@ ation of carbohydrates into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants reach more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU alert system . &quot;
