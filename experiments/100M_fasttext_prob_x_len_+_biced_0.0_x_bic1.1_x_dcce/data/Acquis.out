&quot; II ) Ad@@ voc@@ ating the Community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any point against a given nam@@ ing , the organization of the Community and States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; ( III ) If , due to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is referred to as &quot; General Director &quot; in the following , the Council will discuss the purpose of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their Convention , may actually be able to perform their tasks . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and dis@@ ruption for the Community and States and for the peaceful nuclear activities subordin@@ ated to the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization to be aware of confidential information provided .
&quot; each State turns against the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the duties under this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the privileges and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention are terminated in terms of core material , if the community and the organization determine that the material consum@@ es or has been dil@@ uted in a manner that is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to the provisions of this Convention , the Community identifies the transfer of nuclear material from the States that is subject to the security measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention are terminated with regard to core material as soon as the receiving state , as provided in this Convention , has taken responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to safegu@@ ards under this Convention , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the safegu@@ ards after this Convention can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention on the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organisation and the community shall regulate a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what conditions these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are re @-@ applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the concerned state , or the material in question , and any passing on of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as soon as possible ; it extends only to issues such as temporal and proced@@ ural determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or sec@@ rec@@ y of military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or persons subject to its sovereign authority , however , extraordinary costs arise as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se those costs as long as it has been agreed beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States shall ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages , including an insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ alities of the states . &quot;
any claim that the Community or a State shall assert to the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or the state for damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident - which have ar@@ isen from the implementation of the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention shall be regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the fac@@ tual information submitted by the General Director , the Council shall stipul@@ ate that no core material , which must be subject to security measures under this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II , paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the Council , in which mass has been obtained by the security measures applied , provides the Community or the State - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - any justi@@ fiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be filed with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which shall not be included in the negotiation course or by any other procedure agreed by the Organization , Community and States , at the request of a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed to elect a fifth who heads the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and States or the Organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators after the request for arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected yet .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear @-@ armed states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the respective state of the organization declares that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the organization of the organization declares that it is able to use its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consul@@ ts each other on request of one of the Parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any change in this Convention .
( a ) This Convention shall come into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied to the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning security measures as required .
the aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely identification of the tur@@ no@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a tur@@ no@@ ff through the risk of early discovery .
&quot; in order to reach the target stipulated in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , associated with the spatial interference and observation as important complementary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity not proven for a certain period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
&quot; in carrying out their re@@ visions , the organization after article 3 makes full use of the community &apos;s security system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in applying its securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following ways and , if necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are appropriate : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ ative , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the continu@@ ance of distant core material and stocks ; &quot;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transmitter and receiver ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of not measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each type of material . &quot;
&quot; provisions , which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Convention are not extended to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , entered into the states , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or for is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if the nuclear material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not possible or desired , the organisation and the community should consult each other on the use of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures under this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the Organization of Nu@@ clear Materials , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , exemp@@ ts from these securing measures , if the entire material quantity liberated in the states at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special fis@@ sile material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; freed core material together with core material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organisation complementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective realization of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention are to determine how to apply the procedures set forth in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements may be extended or amended without the amendment of this Convention in the agreement between the Organization and the Community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ in between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report cited in Article 62 , the organization establishes a summ@@ arized repository of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , not@@ withstanding its origin , and carries out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Co @-@ operation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ ale transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this objective . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed conduct and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in what manner it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transactions account &quot; &quot; which is made up of the funds that the Member States may contribute to the special transactions account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transactions account is guided separately and is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; ( a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ appropriate deb@@ its of the member state , which are payable upon request in the currency of the concerned state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the administrative office of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment will be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date stipulated between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker proposes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school &apos;s notes to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transactions account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the case of granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ ruption ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned shall be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply to the objective of the Ad@@ ditional to this agreement under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank or the Organisation for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions generally applicable to the develop@@ mental loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore re@@ payable in 50 years each in 50 years . &quot;
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organization which it reserves .
each special loan is to be indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which the origin of the funds is given in particular .
&quot; the proceeds from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ aker has specified at the time of the loan granted , may be recipient of a special loan . &quot;
&quot; payments made by special transactions are made to the special transactions account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be returned to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator . &quot;
&quot; until the full assignment of all the special transaction loans , the supervis@@ or informs the EEC about the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator receives the E@@ WG quar@@ terly on the development of the special loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transactions account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transactions account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the payments deposited in the account are visible to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the complete edition of the provision of special action accounts from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transactions account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may agree to , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it shall become invalid with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all the bene@@ fici@@ aries used by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States have notified the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure .
the Sec@@ retariat also direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally authentic . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amendment to An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T en@@ acted : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as a Common Company in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Con@@ tract - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; J@@ ET , &quot; which is herein@@ after referred to as &quot; J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been working with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and is very familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement shall enable any contracting party to take advantage of the greatest possible benefit by combining its research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and accordingly the common objective of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the Parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program will take over the long @-@ term goals and the forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs listed in An@@ nex I and II . &quot;
the association appointed in paragraph 1 is realised through : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories that participate in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
Switzerland is participating in the project J@@ ET as part of the present agreement .
&quot; in view of the association agreement stipulated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall include an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those that are called &quot; Association bodies , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom ple@@ dges that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the transfer of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Tre@@ aties on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Company with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , its Stat@@ utes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom ple@@ dges that Switzerland may become the contracting partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the scope of this agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for the implementation of the association appointed in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , shall include the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research and to ste@@ er clear that the best possible outcomes will be achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - referred to as &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is undertaking this task with respect to all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and establishes its T * capability in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common objective laid out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as the common objective laid out in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into consideration the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG al@@ loc@@ ates one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek it . &quot;
&quot; the groups of consultants , who submit to the VG research proposals with regard to that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme are able to provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as to all research and development work that is related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme are optimally util@@ ised , and will be able to fulfil this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;

&quot; the coordination committees , which offer the Committee of Directors suitable proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel , knowledge and skills required to carry out the Eur@@ atom program , are subject to this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the changes in the facilities and the preparation of future programmes and the definition of its total scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the VG statement on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the works of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies that are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount which is equal to the Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of the euro &apos;s gross domestic product , including the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Business as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects the common enterprise J@@ ET an amount that is to be determined according to the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this common company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work as part of the Association Agreement and the Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange , is based on the same basis which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission informs the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year . &quot;
the Federal Council is paying the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 in front of the 15 .
&quot; the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom , in accordance with this article , are laid down in An@@ nex III to the present agreement . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements via the mobil@@ isation of member states &apos; demands within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close the Stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks put an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future pro@@ visi@@ oning funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions have been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared . &quot;
&quot; with each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ Z would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing extensions without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans , as well as their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first accor@@ ds will not be carried out before the end of a month after the termination of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the accor@@ ds would be carried out in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be considered taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z addresses at the time of transactions carried out under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the rate of interest applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor raised by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ S could close the Stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; 2 . the spread @-@ area of the wander@@ ing species is neither temporarily reduced , nor seen in the long term , to be restricted in the future ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
&quot; I honor myself to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the amount of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community is entitled to the protective cl@@ auses , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ ine@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceeded the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a bri@@ ck@@ proof set of 10 b.@@ H .
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount prescribed under number 2 according to the amount of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
import duties for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set to the Community on 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight on the day of the Greek accession to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the community is taking everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ ers and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets provisions so that the sales of frozen meat in frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of the Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , shall only be counted at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agre@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Argentina , in particular , ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that within the quantities specified in this agreement , import lic@@ ences are issued for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged , in its turn , to make all necessary arrangements for obtaining import licenses for the aforementioned products originating in Argentina on the basis of an export licence , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in terms of implementing regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent office of the Community informs the quantities at regular intervals for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to the country of destination . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly functioning .
&quot; it regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats &apos; market of both parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement shall not be carried out according to the Community . &quot;
the Committee discusses all issues arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in view of changes that they consider necessary to understand . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform your government about this .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honor myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure the access to the Community of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb flesh is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the amount of annual amount that actually exp@@ ires does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the prescribed quantities are carried out in the traditional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two Parties shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community adop@@ ts the protective cl@@ auses , it under@@ takes to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a bri@@ ck@@ stone set of 10 BC .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the association in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities laid down in clause 2 according to the size of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
import duties for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 .
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is set to the Community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community .
&quot; the community is taking everything to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets provisions so that the sale of intervention stocks in frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties do everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ r@@ sch in the community without any danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , occurs only at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , especially in the fact that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged , in its turn , to make all necessary arrangements for obtaining import licenses for the aforementioned products originating in New Zealand on the basis of an export licence , which is granted by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in terms of implementing regulations , the competent New Zealand authority of the competent office of the Community informs the quantities at regular intervals for which export lic@@ ences have been granted ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to the country of destination . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly functioning .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goats &apos; market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including conditions that are of importance for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement shall not be carried out according to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee discusses all issues arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of this agreement reached by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for New Zealand &apos;s main territory on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enter into force on 20 October 1980 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 in view of changes that they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I want to suggest that , if your government can agree to the above , that this letter and your answer will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;

&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
it is recommended to add the equipment required for in@@ fusion and the solvent for dry preparations .
human whole blood is taken from a healthy human being and mixed with a suitable anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle through a closed , sterile tube system into which the anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after removal of the blood , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 ° C to 6 ° C. After that , it must be opened again immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti @-@ coag@@ ulation solution must not be more than 220 ml per litre of human full blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 @-@ system is to be determined before the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have revealed the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged according to this Convention shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is to be stored in sterile , sealed bottle from micro @-@ organisms and up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the times necessary for testing and transport , which must be allowed to cool at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood must be cooled down to 4 to 6 C immediately . &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood from which most of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate is either from the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution that was added after removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ it ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by printing . &quot;

&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations , which have signs of bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cent hepatitis , the plasma treatment is to take compounds that do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods that are known to dimin@@ ish this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one goes out during the production of the plasma , is to be put in place ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If 1 ml solution is used , a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ ine or calcium chlori@@ de takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the gross kil@@ n at 37 ° C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ stage drying process in the presence of phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ d under a pressure of a maximum of 0.@@ 02 mm mercury , weight losses over 0.5 % may not occur in human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human drying plasma is stored in a sterile , sealed bottle in a sterile , sealed bottle with the exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of storing any moisture ; it is protected from light and kept at a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and frac@@ tions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component , consisting of about 60 % of the total protein compound of the plasma of the human whole blood . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or other substance on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined twice in a suitable medium .
the titanium is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated only in volume of the blood cells flow in the total volume .
&quot; anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as the complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the ti@@ ter has the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix in a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ration of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml according to definition . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard &quot; anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties will remain intact for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no humidity can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent must not at most lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dried re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfil the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ covering , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an International Convention on a unified system has come about . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent found in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also for conducting tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity within a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; reasonable samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory for so long , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container a black and white printed label can be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ covering , &quot;

anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Gruppe 0 ) blood serum must also indu@@ ce easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % swelling of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same tests are performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flow of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is required when the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flow of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can be one of two types which distinguish themselves by the pre@@ conditions in which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids , such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers as well as hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are absorbed in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements regarding the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .

sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than with the ant@@ an@@ tigen antibodies . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator , separated with swelling of A1 , A2 and A2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur during any fl@@ ushing within the double time , which is required when the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ er@@ ased but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which may be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain a B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator , to ti@@ ze the group B with a fl@@ ushing of blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flow of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is required when the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ er@@ ased but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ inous antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; when used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , there are no un@@ laden human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong to . &quot;

&quot; in the same or other di@@ lution , human red blood cells must also ag@@ glut@@ inate , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh serum with weak complement @-@ binding in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , loading with all types of the above @-@ mentioned in@@ complete antibodies should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seed or other parts of a suitable plant , and , if necessary , cleansing afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ anti@@ gens , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;

&quot; based on article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , &quot; the Parties shall &quot; meet all the necessary measures &quot; to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties ; &quot;
&quot; whereas Member States of the European Economic Community have the obligation to grant this release to the competence of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it has been established , which has the required powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this additional protocol is part of the Convention . from that point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all the States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 , as well as the date of entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in the seri@@ ousness that this Convention shall not be interpreted in detail , that it un@@ bin@@ ds the Parties from their obligations from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transactions in the trade between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after called Single Models ) is introduced , which is to be used without prejudi@@ ce to the type and origin of the goods for all import and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; shipping method &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
the for@@ ti@@ fications associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are granted by means of a single paper for which the prints are to be used in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper is used as a registration or paper for export , for delivery or import . &quot;
&quot; - for the implementation of legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single patent ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties , so that they may come upon request into the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , also in the use of data processing , in terms of further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures may be shown , in particular , that the goods concerned do not place at a customs office and the registration for these goods must not be submitted to the Custom@@ s Office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be authorised . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , a registration must be made subsequently , in which the competent authorities can deal with a periodi@@ c gathering of noti@@ fications within the deadline established by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use trading papers instead of the single paper . &quot;
&quot; if the single document is used , the parties involved in the approval of the competent authorities can be provided with the consent of the competent authorities for the provision of all for@@ ti@@ fications associated with export and import , instead of the supplementary sheets for the single paper on the trade in which the goods are described . &quot;

&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the particular provisions on collective sub@@ missions , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the for@@ ti@@ fications for export and shipping procedures are fu@@ elled on one and the same pres@@ su@@ re@@ ation by means of the copies intended for these for@@ ti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the registration are contained in the individual proceedings of the application . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth trade of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the un@@ covering of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , customs authorities of these countries ask each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from itself all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or denied in whole or in part , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would imp@@ air its safety , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or breach an operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
