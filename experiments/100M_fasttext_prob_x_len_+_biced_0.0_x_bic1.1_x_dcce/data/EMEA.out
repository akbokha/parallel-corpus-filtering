this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; mixed thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a psych@@ ic illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ mood ) alternating with periods of normal temper@@ ament . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melt tablets in patients , where the swal@@ lowing of tablets causes difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also degra@@ ded like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l is probably mainly known as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , such as 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , is smaller than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s efficacy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three trials over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases which suffered from increased turbul@@ ence over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol over twelve weeks in another study comparing the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from increased turbul@@ ence associated with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
&quot; the company also carried out studies to investigate , how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution to take @-@ up ( assimil@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those who received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , acne fever ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly spoke man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were responsive to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee added that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid check of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although some patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ cris@@ y , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l should be used with caution in patients suffering from sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l had increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ i@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before starting the esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ) together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ chat@@ el ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data for safety in humans and because of the concerns caused in the reproductive studies in the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l found a overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with orth@@ ot@@ ex therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium therapy . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS increased 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l has a high plasma tissue connection . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; with the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ ec@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the cau@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sor@@ - Depres@@ sions Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of decline was reported for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zo@@ l , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ tin controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l versus placebo did not show superior efficacy . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a sustained effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium and hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l was superior to placebo for the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l near extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and around 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients did not show any sex @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the mal@@ function of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds with 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ ole in the bile of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole have no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l was superior to placebo for the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed itself superior to placebo for the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , can use the hot melt tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which continued for one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , alternating states of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles may lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l
the following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l was superior to placebo for the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were obtained after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical &quot;
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , can use the hot melt tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , the therapy should continue with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which continued for one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ) together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ tin controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l was compared to a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Extrem@@ ely , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ ole in the bile of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly check A@@ gi@@ pane and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ fer@@ ment of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy mel@@ ee tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ mit@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l injection solution is deemed necessary , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ cris@@ y , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which continued for one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , alternating states of consciousness and indications of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ d@@ se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) was applied in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ i@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before starting the esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of se@@ d@@ se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more commonly reported in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects mentioned below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with or@@ ally applied Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium therapy .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS increased 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose veins , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements in ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as as@@ tig@@ m@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of az@@ ep@@ at@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference Arm . &quot;
the mean improvement from the bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l .
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression diagram , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher decline in the rate of decline compared to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ tin controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l was superior to placebo for the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to achieve maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were taken after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ zi@@ ole in the bile of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters of which had previously been anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medi@@ cam@@ ent of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; only those who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were , in terms of efficacy indicators , such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival , no difference between the drugs . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who are breast @-@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ riches in the blood before starting treatment .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel with no more efficacy than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ cad@@ ence Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ leg@@ m &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; with sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data to recommend dos@@ ages in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel , which may have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ers rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients arrive after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pation remedies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
&quot; before the treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
below are the most common and most important cases of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the recept@@ ors and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved transc@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ac@@ receptor is medi@@ ated and a pac@@ lit@@ axel @-@ accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ tional protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single , irregular trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes . &quot;
this multi@@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel in 3 weeks either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; the results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving the first @-@ line therapy , are below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by an improvement in a level for patients , who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy @-@ 3 at a time during therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel arm after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) rose from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or course band@@ aging of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ axel compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the pac@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following the razor @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
&quot; using a sterile injection , sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid . &quot;
&quot; after the complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then , the pier@@ cing bottle should be slowly and carefully wa@@ ved and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also known as &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss can be expected from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his / her care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; for administration , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study where the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were evaluated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , vom@@ iting mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;

&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the European Union regulations , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operative interventions , which require a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;

H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms and results may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels can occasionally be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an IV application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician is required to assess the individual clinical course and disease condition . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l three times a week , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by &lt; 0,@@ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks prior to the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed treatment .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by a 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to ins@@ ulate the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , inst@@ anti@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic , ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial connec@@ t@@ edness , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ic ( PR@@ CA ) very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of action , defined as ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be assessed by the lab@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( ice , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te index ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical trials increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit resulting from the use of epo@@ e@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who have to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was aimed at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 to 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and related to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ ende@@ mic patients . &quot;
&quot; with the aid of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has specifically stimulated the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ genesis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ genesis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal cancers and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ oses . &quot;
survival and progression of tumour were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients and at inspections .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy , with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis in comparison to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In veter@@ an studies with approximately 20@@ s of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and a rise in red@@ dish mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnostics with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed uniquely for a maximum period of 3 days outside of the cooling case and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a sti@@ cked label , so that if necessary , the dimensions of sub@@ sets are possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing hyper@@ tension .

&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • to obtain new information that may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction related ) mil@@ estones • upon request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month of your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood gra@@ ft formation in veins ( deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example earlier such a blood gra@@ ft has occurred . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the vascular diseases ( vascular disease of the carot@@ en@@ oids ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells , which is again reg@@ ained after further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will carry out regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting the therapy . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by injection to a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value should be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; with increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or un@@ due cor@@ on@@ ary disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood pigment levels ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose appropriately to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if there are already thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , affect the tumour in a negative way . &quot;
&quot; if you have an orthop@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed was to investigate the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your red blood pigment values ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken / applied it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the operation . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y means that no more enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood gra@@ ft formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood samples after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used or rejected within 3 days . &quot;
Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of a stroke ; • Mor@@ bus paste of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should maintain a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that metabol@@ ised bone substance ) was again norm@@ alized in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % against the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared with those of placebo . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of frac@@ ture frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the Ac@@ last@@ a manufacturer provides information for doctors to prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug should be explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ last@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and include the following core messages : • Recommen@@ dation in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to get back to medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; following a treatment by the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly recommended that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get receive adequate calcium intake , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ last@@ a .
&quot; for patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy are absent .
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated before the onset of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly recommended that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get receive adequate calcium intake , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
no data is available for patients who need dental handles whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON ) , Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which were referred to as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cholesterol ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cholesterol within 10 days of the administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed up to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ id@@ a in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the oral part has been implic@@ ated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zinc cit@@ ric acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ es . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw@@ s near a patient treated with acet@@ last@@ a and in a placebo treated with placebo .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ ture frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ id@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of frac@@ ture frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the scar@@ ring by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the basin a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture .
&quot; bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was maintained at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D by comparison to placebo treatment at all times . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % to the total frac@@ ture and 4,@@ 3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the monthly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate compared to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper average value when taken into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain relief compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response could be maintained at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bio @-@ phase dis@@ appearing from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ ur@@ ation phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the t ½ -@@ values above ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at the time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearance of substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al @-@ acting IV single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
&quot; for studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats was given by dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects have occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on risk management systems for human medicinal products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Pa@@ get &apos;s mor@@ bus , bone conversion is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , restoring normal bone formation and restoring strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you take medicines that are known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using Ac@@ last@@ a , together with food and beverages , you are concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a If you are considering the completion of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / pun@@ cture , nausea , diar@@ rhe@@ a , diar@@ rho@@ ea , inflammation of the stomach , diar@@ rhe@@ a , inflammation of the stomach , pain , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , swelling , it@@ ching , red@@ dish comple@@ xi@@ on , tissue damage and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed are adver@@ sely affected or you notice side effects not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a must be carried out two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( Body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over or over ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies of more than 7 000 patients were conducted in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for the setting of smoking compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this application area was difficult to assess . &quot;
what is the risk associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it &apos;s the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia detected during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory passages . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is the package contents .
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients suffering from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and may cause a small minority of patients to call su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy against fung@@ al infections ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing explanations for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
it Ad@@ ditional to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) which have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or depres@@ sive symptoms with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; even in patients who , in addition to obesity , have no apparent risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms arise .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied , is assumed that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; patients with obesity as well as in patients with obesity were examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients suffering from weight reduction and metabolic diseases .
&quot; when the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t &quot;
&quot; only slight symptoms were observed in a tolerance study , in which a limited number of individuals were given one @-@ time roy@@ alties of up to 300 mg . &quot;
&quot; in the event of inclusion , the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia . &quot;
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , relative to the initial value compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .

&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z &quot;

&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be connected with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be used in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) that cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ filler or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ e , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3,5 years . &quot;
&quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trial , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients reported to decrease the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thetic ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are com@@ promised by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular Out@@ come Study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased exit @-@ liver enz@@ ym@@ values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T level is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms which indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one continues , should be guided by clinical evaluation to the laboratory parameters . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be obtained from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ way combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but regulatory doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on visual acuity . an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a 3.5 year study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thus the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not invaluable in this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as in placebo , but less often than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , the frequency of severe heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency has rarely been reported under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in treated groups was conducted . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial lasting 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal versus mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients suffering from g@@ lic@@ la@@ ins ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin despite three months of optimization , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values was observed . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients for 18 weeks .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as minor but clin@@ ically significant elevated blood cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma en@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal , and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zed values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the an@@ tigen tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular outcomes study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , whereby the top concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness corresponds to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies it could be proven that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; following oral application of radio@@ actively labeled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral clearance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys following repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the creation dimin@@ ishes and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ds led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a 3.5 year study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal were investigated .
&quot; in clinical trials for more than one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the an@@ tigen tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed with 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were similarly reduced to other human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package contents ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; in case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , a dose adaptation is required , this can be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 B@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ to@@ sis in uter@@ o . &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods .
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the fis@@ sion is active .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adaptation is required in case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

this may happen : • If you in@@ ject to too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal - if you do more than otherwise physically
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s pens whenever it is not in use to protect it from light .

follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and to ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ ast with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
&quot; if air bubbles are present , they will be collected in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • While you keep the injection needle upwards , turn the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • While the injection needle continues upwards , press the button ( Figure C ) • Now you have to release a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Place the cap again on the production pen , that the digit 0 stands opposite the dosing stamp ( Figure D ) • Control if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;

&quot; 107 • Please note the highest number you can see on the button scale • Ad@@ de the two numbers to get the selected dose • If you have adjusted a wrong dose , turn the cap easily for@@ wards or backwards until you have adjusted the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you can sense a resistance , then take the cap off and reset it so that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite . &quot;
be sure to press the button only during injection • Ke@@ ep the button pressed until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin after the injection .
&quot; it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you cannot use it to adjust or select your dose . &quot;

the dose can be adjusted both to the top and down by turning the dosage knob in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is compared to the marking of the dose indication .
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; , &quot; i.e. larger crystals of ur@@ anium , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there is still a risk of sei@@ zur@@ es ; therefore it is recommended that patients take other medicines for the prevention of g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of the treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with one placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in plaque buil@@ du@@ p ( including one known or currently present gyp@@ sum node and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum for 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose elevation can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ saw medicines , there may be acute sei@@ zur@@ es during the course of treatment , because the lowering of the serum lake &apos;s cone first allows to mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; in cases of malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so widespread in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the ﬁ@@ sh treatment and in the further course of the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in zinc did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adaptation for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily reported an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be excluded from the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when paying a vehicle , service of machines or when carrying out dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ et in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 vs. 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials , no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
the events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 or with lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness of skin , erectile dysfunction , kidney failure , kidney failure , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month were given specific serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum acid level at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function in@@ suffici@@ ency The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentrations in subjects irrespective of ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the height of the rheum@@ atism , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) by F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma treatment of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ely glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / h in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell carcin@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a consequence of specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a decrease in the intake capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 13 @-@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in regard to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared with those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also submitted data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , vom@@ it ( ul@@ cer disorders ) , tum@@ ul@@ cers ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic encounter . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of pharmaceuticals ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow the instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by malign@@ ant strokes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that may point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active heart@@ burn or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to patients and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , it was rare ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens were predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether or not the onset of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a deeper surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ deficiency of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the dose next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but was also reported in the case of oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; however , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ dic@@ ation of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 de@@ hydr@@ ate cholesterol to vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ gen D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum Cal@@ cium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved with the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new frac@@ ture rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before starting a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at distri@@ butes itself temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted to the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of a radio@@ active marker of vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the rot after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data are available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been conducted and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , as the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alterations of the formulation and the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed checks of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood @-@ level measurements ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; systemic exposure , measured as valley level , was comparable to both ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ ted patients on Day 4 . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low clearance matter , adapting the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose can take several days to reach the Ste@@ ady State . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow drug use in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For supp@@ ressing the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy can therefore not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Pre@@ vention of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can alter in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t receptor of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake by Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dosage recommended for kidney and liver transplan@@ tation should begin once a day for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once a day .
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients - though there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , arrived at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in pancre@@ atic patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , patients with reduced kidney function can assume that dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ atine content and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f at the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of solid blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us control .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; even after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration , should be checked ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance level , adjustments of the dose may take several days before the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the seb@@ um levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the seb@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels in the whole blood lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over @-@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alterations of the formulation and the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed checks of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , since the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations under such conditions . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infection , fluid contamination and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , show symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special care is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary corne@@ a intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose cluster mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or lower the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive reci@@ pro@@ cal effect was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies show that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; hence , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in contrast to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants a higher risk of un@@ desirable events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy is possible .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs can often be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects following their frequency are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data not invaluable ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high adhesion to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis able . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory . &quot;
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) , 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm were 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplan@@ tation The effectiveness and safety of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ phy C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) for Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsule used twice a day after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ ted , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and used in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , which received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival after one year was 8@@ 0.@@ 8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ do and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it came into 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the creation of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml / 5 .
&quot; in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine , and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine , and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row expansion , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ ge 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximate 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application determine whether Adv@@ ents are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; hem@@ ophi@@ lia A patients suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood coag@@ ulation problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any protein of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings and surgical procedures was examined . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood vessels was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transport of advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following here@@ tical events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the indicated plasma seal ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during treatment , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 Proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or when the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always to be quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using the modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic , known inhibit@@ or development , switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors has been observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the number of A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients was inhibit@@ ors to VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ levels occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) has been diagnosed with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;

&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms which showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported in the study of the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other IV products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for activating factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder will apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in to treat Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
it is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus no infection can cause infection in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells , if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the exam of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that lawyers can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not assume the CH@@ MP to know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; &quot; programmes with lawyers . &quot;
&quot; changed release agents &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in severity of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , mouth @-@ dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , anor@@ ex@@ ia ( loss of appetite ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( hyper@@ tension ) or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without swe@@ ating , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this can be attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient team and the data do not suff@@ ice to discuss appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data do not suff@@ ice to discuss appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be tested at least 48 hours before the implementation of the@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka will otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ al processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ active cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess in the recommended dose of 5 mg per day compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can produce further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant difference in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city adher@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the oral application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n metabol@@ ised bad metabolism . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure after administration of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally linked to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ ads , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to verify that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take up and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of as@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the present disease course and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been completed and re @-@ resum@@ ed .
the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it can come to light that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ active cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses administered in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria is representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ al factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n besides chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria also results in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ full film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ mo @-@ free , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ mo @-@ less , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to exclusion from upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged 2 to 11 is identical to that in children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose cluster removal or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not enhance the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup @-@ group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose for 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with placebo treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ ol dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not impaired by psych@@ omot@@ or in clinical trials in adults and adolescents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in boo@@ sting alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance or increasing drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in a limited manner .
the load ( AU@@ C ) due to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no evidence points for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In several single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable in the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is offered in type III bracelet bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;

the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
overall incidence of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at to the inhal@@ ation formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose Cros@@ sover studies by A@@ eri@@ us processed tabl@@ et@@ op using A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

in single dose Cros@@ sover studies by A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 years that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in a limited way is identical to that in children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a Fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ I@@ som@@ er@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; infants aged between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and tablets . &quot;
several single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable in the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company res@@ umes its application to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because people have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus present in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane surface of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as foreign to the body ) was clean@@ sed and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ generative is available as a solution to take @-@ up , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; it should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the patient &apos;s anti@@ viral medicines , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of car@@ bun@@ cles is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , aspir@@ in reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and maintains it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to be cured , but can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ generative medicine strengthened with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who used to be prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks of gener@@ osity , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who further recovered their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded as well as aspir@@ in and are inj@@ uri@@ ous in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking care are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by a relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ap@@ las@@ h@@ esis in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; gener@@ al@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of azi@@ v@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ pi@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , as@@ cer@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r combined with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generative capsules and a solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generative capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; arom@@ a@@ therapy may not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cean 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that an@@ ne@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , generic drugs should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver @-@ side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including the C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ V@@ ast@@ atin are highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving these medicines at the same time , am@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on pi@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ al content of the A@@ generative Solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be reduced in duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases in which medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ angi@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting from severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not coinci@@ de with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and are also substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ cean 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mostly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused an 82 % reduction of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s AU@@ C , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ ary mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; on the other hand , 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600@@ mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % was reduced if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ ab@@ os@@ in and aspir@@ in is at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub @-@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with an@@ ne@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could be increased the plasma levels of both drugs in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can possibly result in interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ a as it may cause respiratory disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enz@@ ym@@ atic duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pin , phi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin ,
&quot; simultaneous use with as@@ cer@@ oses can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and reinforce the side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma was decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of am@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increases in plasma gas when administration is administered simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used together with oral m@@ mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while be@@ ware of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma treatment of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by the 3 to 4 @-@ barrel .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on pi@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with con@@ current administration of arom@@ a@@ therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ cer@@ oses has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ generic or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and solid sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 survivors of non @-@ treated individuals , who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( breast cancer ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated patients with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or spot@@ less nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be abor@@ ted with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received am@@ ase together with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe the signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ vor@@ es with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in case of acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed . &quot;
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 Isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 4@@ V , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ pi@@ ous mut@@ ations :
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , combined with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r generates a certain cross resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r generally remains intact . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses did not cause pre @-@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , appear to call forth Lun@@ ar / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ pi@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ tik@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) treated with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ency threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ paid ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ generic solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ in should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous eating intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r representing the active part is likely to remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State beyond the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with care if they are given at the same time with as@@ cer@@ oses ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose of A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generative Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
&quot; ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , who had an exposure to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , gave little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , M@@ ouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations were present in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has yet been observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ cer@@ oses nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; however , with a systemic plasma display which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generative capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 . for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be reduced in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused an 82 % reduction of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s AU@@ C , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma was decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a 22 % decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fo@@ etus .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ cer@@ oses has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe the signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in case of acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ pi@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ in should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with care if they are given at the same time with as@@ cer@@ oses ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , who had an exposure to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cytes aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , revealed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , M@@ ouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured in young animals , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;

&quot; the benefit of patients treated with p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ generative Solution was neither approved in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generative capsules and a solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ generative Solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ al content , A@@ generative Solution is contra@@ indicated in case of small children and children under 4 years , pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that an@@ ne@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 from HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be reduced in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ angi@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused an 82 % reduction of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s AU@@ C , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use with as@@ cer@@ oses can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for the human being is unknown . A@@ generic solution for taking up may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body@@ weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ cer@@ oses has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ generic or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed . &quot;
early canc@@ elation of a promising 60 treatment is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ in should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , with a systemic plasma display which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;

your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply generic drugs together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of as@@ gener@@ a .
the use of as@@ gener@@ a will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned diseases or take any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ generic ase capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting treatment . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there is no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ generic ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to boost efficiency in children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot;

&quot; the benefit of patients with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was neither used in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors or patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;

important information about certain other components of A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking up The solution to take @-@ in contains propylene gly@@ col which can lead to side effects in high doses .
&quot; propylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ a must not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;

&quot; application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times weekly for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and performed either weekly or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with placebo , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic or hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has to continue for a long time until all visible war@@ ts in the genital or peri@@ anal region have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ yst@@ erec@@ tomy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a tri@@ mming leading to circumc@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed even under appropriate application , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; in order to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous uses applied to the treatment of external inc@@ lines in the genital and peri@@ anal region , no clinical experience has yet to be found . &quot;
&quot; although limited data points to an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser efficacy in this patient population in relation to the elimination of the war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during the treatment or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there is no clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
only very limited data can be found on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually take off in the course of the treatment of intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data from an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although there are no quanti@@ fiable levels of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) after a single application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of inc@@ lines ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
the side effects described by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week @-@ weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently occurred to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ aling / shed ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination increased systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the inc@@ lines in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the inc@@ lines were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had placebo treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ colour application per week was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications for external inc@@ ision , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages examined ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ tered in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single @-@ use bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study of der@@ mal application carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for human beings is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; - If any of the listed side effects are adver@@ sely affected or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itals ( gen@@ itals ) and anus ( anus ) ● Over@@ face bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to dischar@@ ging , especially in the face - hence early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only in flat ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , or the virus responsible for the infection with war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only if the area to be treated is healed after a previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by fl@@ ushing with water . o Do not apply the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Do not apply cream as your doctor prescri@@ bes you . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which will give you severe in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are clari@@ fied , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or difficulty of the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased incidence of con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream to ureth@@ ra , vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other drugs serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is carried out . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; do not breast@@ feed your infant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine enters the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of til@@ ting , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean dry skin spot with the war@@ ts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
men with war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks each week , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( expect to expect more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( with less than 1 of 100 patients expected ) rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 1,000 patients expected ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster or it can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are adver@@ sely affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sor@@ eness , skin irrit@@ ation , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , weak@@ ening of the nose , skin feeling or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , throat pain , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

&quot; the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and , where necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. authorization to market Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ induced reactions which are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should be closely monitored closely and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase III study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically elevated risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ ren@@ ca ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended that you do not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants of less than 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequency ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients showed a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version within 3 months of treatment , with a more severe type of serum for patients aged 5 and older ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase III study ( or until an early withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no detection of det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; patients with a low antibody level showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions were typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and walking ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
&quot; the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period , and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children . &quot;
&quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ at@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established that remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variable ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients ( 16 patients with the severe exp@@ iry form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined by the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ iry only limited or no advances in cognitive development were determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ as is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .

tips for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ s and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • inflammation of the joints • joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is probably easily spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( pharmaceuticals against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dropped or reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ium , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the treatment of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared with 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta indicated long survival times compared to the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to promote the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle needs to be resolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick size is extracted from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ a- or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for pre@@ valent plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed application and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each application - including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection must take place taking into account the tigh@@ tening of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reductions an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies have shown no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the highest limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone pal@@ at@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ te count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene number , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ab@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the out@@ flow before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( excluding yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treat@@ ment@@ - to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
it is therefore advisable to apply high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy except if necessary , and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passed into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed sur@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ ties .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the summ@@ ar@@ ised results of three single phase re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy studies except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC that random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC that random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was determined for the inclusion of all events in which the doctor conducted a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) patients were random@@ ised to include c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving ran@@ - dom@@ ises c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin , and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal ble@@ ed@@ ings , sometimes fatal , intestinal inflammation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and typ@@ ho@@ litis ) were reported . &quot;
in clinical trials cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in post @-@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics have been reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic antibody that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ sensitive metabolic processes , which are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;

&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ om showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed a clin@@ ically significant benefit to patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) using the Lun@@ - gen@@ ome cancer symptom scale ( 2@@ 12 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months ( int@@ eger to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival of the overall survival occurred in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disc epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study show efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = equal @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ under@@ age limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie diets . &quot;
patients who take allergy and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , whereby about a quarter of the fats given to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 60 mg of total weight had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s of anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , stools , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) and in pregnant women or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit to transport or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; allergy is indicated for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fatty alcohol @-@ induced diet . &quot;
All@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 since there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed only minimal , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • breast@@ feeding time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases , with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years in clinical trials remained in the normal range of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the administration of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events voluntarily were reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal overweight and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; most of the cases reported after the market launch have either no side effects or similar side effects , as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid rep@@ atri@@ ation of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pi@@ ous properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ ed li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; from clinical trials it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which has been taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) were evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both trials , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with a placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any indication of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after sec@@ tioning the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) were identified , which accounted for nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the market must make sure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;
&quot; risk management planning The holder of approval for the marketing application under@@ takes to carry out studies and additional phar@@ ma @-@ risk activities as described in the phar@@ ma @-@ risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in October 2008 as per module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as all further updates of the R@@ MPs , which are agreed with the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP guidelines on risk management systems for human medicine products , the updated R@@ MP must be submitted simultaneously with the next P@@ SU@@ R ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • if new information is available that will affect current safety policies , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction activities • within 60 days of reaching an important mil@@ estones related to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction • on request by the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects depend on the effect of the capsules , resulting in the fact that fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize dietary restrictions : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; when you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat quantity evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main course or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you do not walk or walk daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and adhere to it . • Re@@ ally is a food diary containing information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fatty acid and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a tailor @-@ made program to support weight loss , these information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adult patients receiving chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the transport of Alo@@ xi to the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
&quot; Alo@@ xi &apos;s efficacy in the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with am@@ nesty ob@@ struction or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable given the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which are prone to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is said to be used neither for prevention nor treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics examined ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron experiences in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) have been reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ium over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following preliminary clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the capability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. dose @-@ administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV dose an initial decrease in plasma concentrations results from a slow elimination of the body with an average temporal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was equivalent to 3 consecutive days , the total composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous stu@@ ds injection , total length was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver function disorder , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , indicating low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose in roughly the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) which were given daily over two years led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since al@@ oh@@ xi is used by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report recommen@@ ding the approval of the drug @-@ approved drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should be similar to a medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; during a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damage . furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme of Alan@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ alities are increased . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturer submitted data that att@@ est to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medication to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 weeks and 6 months after the treatment was treated ( i.e. , no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease resum@@ ed in more patients than with the reference agent ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated for examining the question of the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ gel resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go could not be effective against this kind of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo said to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home , about 90 % of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been prov@@ able or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. permission to market Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation caused by the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has begun . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was in@@ sufficiently in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral in@@ gest@@ ing and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to admini@@ ster systemic antibiotics .
&quot; in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continues , is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the place of administration about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( previously ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer centre .
&quot; binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding Inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms appear question@@ able , a consultation by experts should be aimed at . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in relation to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary , traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ cation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in human beings after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo evaluation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of abra@@ ded skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study at rats , at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected . &quot;

irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons to the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ments look on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a Gaz@@ ette cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic zi@@ pper which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged 1 to 15 who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a two @-@ way vacc@@ ination plan , with a protection against hepatitis B possible only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be taken out of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is required for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis B or B vaccine . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; contributing &quot; &quot; to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine , approved since 1996 , and the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix child approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination existing from three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the portion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children trial the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix carried out a month after the last injection of vacc@@ inated children between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole . &quot;
&quot; the standard plan for the basic di@@ mming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
vacc@@ ination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated using the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody being reached after pri@@ ming the immune system , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these injection methods should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mask @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ el vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer and preser@@ v@@ ative formulation formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 up to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and ability on a basis of the calculation per V@@ acc@@ lim@@ eter Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis for calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ urities was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; statisti@@ cally , the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines in the age of 1 to including 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. , month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serum sample rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , 6 given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ at@@ orial vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine compared with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , month 7 ) are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ ur@@ p m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates as well as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ cu@@ ding of possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require hosp@@ ital@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B before being administered ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) an vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be con@@ stru@@ ed . &quot;
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
&quot; at a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective constitu@@ ents ( 360 ELISA ) of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the completion of the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected into the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has been given / has been planned or this is planned in the near future .
it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambition will not be given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is necessary to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 c@@ ased doses ) : • pain or discomfort in the stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ ency • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
&quot; ♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 c@@ ased doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness , gastro@@ intestinal complaints &quot;
&quot; further side effects , which were reported very rarely in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced cans ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include local limited or extended extracts that can be it@@ ching or ves@@ icle @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and face , start@@ ling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have been known since the initial approval of the market , the CH@@ MP represented that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient expos@@ ures . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ y can also be used in patients aged over a month with an in@@ trin@@ sic enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ k could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , am@@ mon@@ y can lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ k was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because limited information about this medicine was available at the time of approval due to the r@@ arity of the disease . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme defect is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of the live ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first life month ) , there is an indication for the use when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ce .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as in patients with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ forming . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate is done through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients suffering from liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these un@@ desirable events it was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who has developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
an over@@ dose case occurred during a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which at intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) of 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ genic hormone deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were calculated using a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after intake . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients suffering from ur@@ inary cycle disturbances or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma the next morning after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no lam@@ ented effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children still unable to take tablets or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ a or a nas@@ al prob@@ es .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ce .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat @-@ tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there were lesi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who has developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that for each gram of recorded sodium but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; following an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after intake . &quot;
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient may retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine through a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , post@@ age of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital in order to initiate an appropriate treatment . &quot;

&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al tube ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Dis@@ cover the recommended number of spo@@ ons Gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for instance in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stroke &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in single administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks , or Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for serious ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ant , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during AC@@ S treatment and PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if there is a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a stroke of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV formulation of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate @-@ severe ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is 225 seconds , a second one dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT again to check the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the bi@@ vali@@ ant Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the IV dose of frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased risk of bleeding caused by a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ og@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe ren@@ al damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even though most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ vali@@ ant , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ant , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant is reached once again the level before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ant with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters in each case are regularly checked . &quot;
&quot; in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ant alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the bi@@ vali@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in table 2 .
both light and severe ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ ant patients than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl with known blood circulation , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , performed at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following data on side effects are based on the data from a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the bi@@ vali@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether it is bound in liquid phase or cl@@ ot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vou@@ ro@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ant with serum from patients in which in the past the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed subsequently , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ ant should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , non @-@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes needing treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or upper arm or is administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot operate insulin effectively . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro was observed after six months . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be used either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to use sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections through continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal area . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active force , the brand ( Her@@ - or ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din , and reser@@ pine , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter regulation may be weakened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a suit@@ ably trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ cos@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in case of hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male patients aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , exactly like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ lowering effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; it was obvious from the data that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if an insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( picture 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
