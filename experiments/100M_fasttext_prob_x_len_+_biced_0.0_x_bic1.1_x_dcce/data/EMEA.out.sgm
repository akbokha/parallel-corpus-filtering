<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you would like more information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"mixed thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a psychic illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) alternating with periods of normal temperament."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melt tablets in patients, where the swallowing of tablets causes difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also degraded like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neurotransmitters."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibrazil is probably mainly known as a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripibrazil, such as 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, is smaller than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripibrazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abilify's efficacy to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which suffered from increased turbulence over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol over twelve weeks in another study comparing the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from increased turbulence associated with Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also carried out studies to investigate, how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution to take-up (assimilated)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased restlessness than those who received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugar), acne fever (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly spoke manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were responsive to the treatment with Aripibrazole."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee added that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid check of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripibrazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although some patients may benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripibrazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even when treated with Aripibrazil (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk with Aripibrazil compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripibrazl should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypocrisy, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoceleriated and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripibrazil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripibrazil should be used with caution in patients suffering from seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripibrazil in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripibrazil had increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripibrazil."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurry, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripibrazil on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripibrazil is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"H2 antagonist Famidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripibrazil, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripibrazil by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibrazil compared to CYP2D6 Extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height before starting the escort therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram (or CYP2D6) together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripibrazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethylorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (Omechatel) and 3A4 (Dextromethylorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripibrazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data for safety in humans and because of the concerns caused in the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripibrazil has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects appeared more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripibrazil found a overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripibrazil treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study for more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripibrazil and 15.1% in patients with orthotex therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripibrazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripibrazil treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium therapy."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS increased 18.2% for patients under Aripibrazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripibrazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibrazil, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional overdosages with Aripibrazil alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripibrazil, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripibrazil has a high plasma tissue connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripibrazil in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripibrazil showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT7-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with the administration of Aripibrazil in dosages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racecprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the caucleus caudatus and on the putty."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripibrazil showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the share of responder patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripibrazil 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assor- Depressions Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial for more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of decline was reported for Aripibrazol, which was at 34% in the Aripibrazl group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olantin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripibrazil showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripibrazil versus placebo did not show superior efficacy."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripibrazil showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a sustained effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, in week 12 Aripibrazil showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium and haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or Valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripibrazil showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved remission with Aripibrazil during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripibrazil was superior to placebo for the prevention of a reversal in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripibrazil, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripibrazil near extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and around 146 hours with 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripibrazil there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients did not show any sex-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences in respect of ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripibrazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripibrazl and Dehydro-Aripibrazil were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the malfunction of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripibrazil and Dehydro-Aripibrazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular hazards to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds with 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripibraziole in the bile of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the sulphate-conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripibrazole found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydroxy- Aripibrazole have no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane was diagnosed with 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"the study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>

<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in severity of the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerosaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aeronaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), mouth-dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (loss of appetite), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="1696">"the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant difference in terms of gender, age or ethnicity adherence."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerosaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma."</seg>

<seg id="2040">No low-dose kritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value."</seg>

<seg id="2638">"after intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was equivalent to 3 consecutive days, the total composition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after a one-time intravenous dose of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one-time dose of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>

<seg id="2643">"after a one-time intravenous studs injection, total length was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although in patients with severe liver function disorder, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, indicating low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of palonosetron (each dose in roughly the 30s of the therapeutic exposure in humans) which were given daily over two years led to an increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pankreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes needing treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or is administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in a study involving 878 adults, Apidra has been studied in type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot operate insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro was observed after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH for the transport of Apidra across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be used either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to use subcutaneous injections through continuous infusion in the abdominal area."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active force, the brand (Her- or), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
