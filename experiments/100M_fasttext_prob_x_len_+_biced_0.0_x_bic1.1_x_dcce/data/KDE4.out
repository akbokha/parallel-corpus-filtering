package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
for more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extension .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the view filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : this element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of mapping ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; Unix command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View Color Mode can either display depth for the easy identification of the merge depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space is available for representation or whether the area of sub@@ or@@ derly rec@@ tan@@ gles may occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses as a frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum presented area for an entry on the View View menu item . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ass .
the Photo Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation panel to set the number of images of each row in the gallery .
display the File Name box in the image to see if the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
display the file size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
display the image size check box to see if the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save file in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original images to the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box sel@@ ector color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or menu in the Tools HTML Settings menu . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or by short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click in the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access with browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not conform to the W3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
setting up menu entry ... allows you to set the size of the information on the browser used and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or menu on the Tools webpage . you can make the following ex@@ ams :
with the &amp; HTML ; check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds to all found errors . with this check you can make sure that your pages are represented correctly by all browsers .
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used .
check the links on your site for further instructions and faulty links . recur@@ sively all links on the website are checked .
here you specify the addresses of the server for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ Documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module Web Archi@@ ver for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save websites with text and images in .@@ was format .
&quot; click on the Tools page with the mouse , and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; work together . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; simple to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users .
&quot; whenever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers may help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ;
the best start to get up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; will additionally be used as a legacy library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s hidden in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can edit and edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw Cam@@ eras in the Help Disk Support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the phases of raw Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; work together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and are slow transmission over the serial port , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ c@@ am can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as there may be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; itself . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
&quot; drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can take a picture in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ d , via the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only limitation is that one image can not be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the icon view currently . thus , the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind icon view is also displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ quit quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; quot ; are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they are stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped together under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Test@@ ers : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . &quot;
&quot; when you first select an album in &amp; quot ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , right click the picture and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . in addition you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be scra@@ pped .
album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be shown in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by re @-@ creating all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can change your settings dialog . select here the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help window that appears . when you let the mouse ho@@ ver a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all what it came about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements to this . you can select all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . you can choose between viewing the pictures , sli@@ deshow or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image using the right mouse button and editing ... . in the digi@@ code section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by pressing the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in &amp; out ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing through other image processing programs , problems with the metadata shown in the image may occur . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotating . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ code , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Data Limit ; organizes your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been selected with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags lo@@ gically . you can also easily locate parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ aison , so you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and allocated cat@@ ch@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu will appear that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , right click the picture and select it as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to add with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can provide a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can choose a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword where you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo , and select Rem@@ ove from the Rem@@ ove menu . the menu displays only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ bi@@ er search box is a small lamp that will be green when searching finds hits . if you click here , filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if the search does not find anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will see a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as search criteria .
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the header and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; for more information , see The Advanced Search Tool section . for more information , see The Advanced Search Tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the legacy database . all rules are line @-@ by @-@ line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it . additionally , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; it allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hands @-@ free colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; finds the suitable images . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires your images to contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ code ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ tly from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right part of the window . if you choose to synchron@@ ize from the toolbar and perform zo@@ oming operations on one of the images , you can also compare them with the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairs of pairs to navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the sections to compare . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table , such as F@@ 4 File Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you have to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom controller under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are previ@@ ewed in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos results in a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , editing , mapping , archiving , optimizing , waiting and export of image files . &quot;

metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it certainly not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archive on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure information structure as opposed to the data structure . you need to decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata in the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently store the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign key words , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently use in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you bz@@ w the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ structure to another . the changed keywords will be edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed while it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the square . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as a label . if you export your images to web galleries , then these labels will be exported according to your wishes in the label and / or title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; remember the times in front of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in Goo@@ gle@@ Maps ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the working description of the photographer . examples of this may be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who has the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate failures , plate failures , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , problems with the so @-@ called New Media are concerned . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; visual media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs is , of course , also for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . afterwards , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ppy manufacturers will keep track of your stat@@ s . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; in short , disks will last the longest if you run in the Temper@@ ature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temper@@ ing , the failure rate increases dramatically . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power loss before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t make much power , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage to your computer . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy seats and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should be aware that it meets UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to work even further up the current runs . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they will meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS can be used for less than € 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates capable of dealing with disk errors at a low level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . &quot;
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms as the Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of thi@@ eves is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 stops settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro , so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make every day your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; forget planes : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , to the neighboring house , to your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for loss of data despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup has been made .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh . &quot;
back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or a different optical medium .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore loss . at the same time , you come up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file , IP@@ TC information associated with X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way than to have a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ db : change the size of the ser@@ fs if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard developed by GIF . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to recommend g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed by DN@@ G because of the need to standardi@@ ze camera data . a handful of camera cre@@ ators are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block ; -@@ technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ Tags ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . however , X@@ MP is able to store metadata separately from the image file . however , it can lead to problems when linking metadata file and image file , and as mentioned above , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera screen , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze , then you should add the metadata again . it may be trun@@ cated from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , code them to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the Tab@@ s metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , vendor comment , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata page strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then the selection from all . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam , and we recommend to check if the pictures were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected download is st@@ owed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is shown , like normal folder , and the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section . select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , you will need to select them first and delete them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully released ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this through the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos of different recording galleries to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ folders . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens three additional options , which are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use a different date format than the default format , e.g. in the editing field you can use the pre@@ fix photo % % % % % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the instruction str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically once you open the camera window the next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ version at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you , where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it refers to a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ gra@@ ze an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that id@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a couple working with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo

&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . to access these settings , you need to select in the Settings menu ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; be sure if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be listed here as this is the picture . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image , and not only in the edited &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed without losing . &quot;
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that has none of these extensions , edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illuminated button by &amp; quot ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , whenever you open the illuminated table , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this view mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance density than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ ress the TI@@ FF @-@ files with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF image . it does not affect image quality , since the de@@ fi@@ l algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; save los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files can save you los@@ s@@ less . even if you select los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; default is that all green pixels are equal . if the odd green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images that are burned down due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as a continuous white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the spot@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . therefore , d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Recon@@ struction option you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ cap ; to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; after some tests it looks like that . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) , the quality for me and the paper used by me was created . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening , as it is carried out during the raw conversion process . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a colour space to translate into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
questions about how to open a picture in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
&quot; profile Fol@@ der Fol@@ der the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then examine this folder during startup . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; to deposit for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file later . &quot;
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should be matched to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , that do not contain any color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how to print your image from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore highly saturated . this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style of the destination : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ cap ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn off the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left side show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Identi@@ fication , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below you are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on . &quot;
&quot; check whether &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any denom@@ ination for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option dialog for moving images to the tr@@ ash bin , you can preview the conversation by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
the editorial changes made by the right side@@ bar can still be tac@@ it through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
&quot; you can also see the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when starting , it may accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; &quot;

different color schemes can be in &amp; edited ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for and digi@@ ti@@ zed , you will find further information on this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the entry View / Edit menu .
&quot; the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules please refer to the section image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; editing functions of image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved the Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before changing it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or the button Rec@@ over the image processing re@@ producing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saved . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored , and the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or restoring the edit back from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ connect . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture down or entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do so , you can edit it in the editing dialog from &amp; digi@@ pe@@ .@@ This can be viewed from the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the menu album . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is , without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
&quot; in the label view , you can insert or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC cap@@ tion field in other applications you should observe these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Evaluation section displays a score of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords used before . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have lots of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding cross fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the section Key@@ word Fil@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the Key@@ word keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection quantity of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the keyword is already there , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper sample , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right key tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; if you have created and created a rule and find that it has to be a rule , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ cap ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at any point of image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make available links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , see Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate my monitor if I choose to work in s@@ RGB color space ?
&quot; whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB is associated with s@@ RGB . if you are working as a s@@ RGB colour space , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , comparing , automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise Automatic Cor@@ rection attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity values across the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . &quot;
&quot; the same method adju@@ sts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . this results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram . &quot;
extend contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the upper right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
to play An@@ stat with the above controls you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance to the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance you set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
&quot; the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image can be set here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of shell images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Col@@ oring Management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so you always have the same error and you always need the same correction . you will find more information in the manual on tone correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Tool Far@@ ming Eff@@ ects provides you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a filter filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was called &quot; &quot; Sab@@ ati@@ er &quot; , &quot; an effect that was created by replacing a partially developed pressure with a short flash beam and afterwards the development of the image completed . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ is effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a color film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on@@ light simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than raise it . all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument tone correction is used to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the sli@@ ders for the application described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the pane and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control knob and watch out how the image changes .
&quot; on the right you can see the original and the preview of the image . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear history is most useful . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the mid tones , often called gam@@ eplay . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin titles can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to inter@@ actively edit output values as in the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most sensible . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short@@ cut to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with the own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the color components . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . tin@@ ting consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Download buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer settings for later , then load them . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ph@@ il@@ ter : produces warm light and middle tones while adding a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ ep@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed below ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame add the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired type of frame for your image . passing through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce will surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
use the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool template you can place a template on a picture .
the Menu Pat@@ tern to apply in the image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to decrease the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the Tem@@ plate , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ cap ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tization @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to set your template folder with the &quot; &quot; base folder &quot; &quot; button in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template of the templates automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools to focus . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it rather works psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
some scann@@ ers already use a focus filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it you get the control over your image .
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the focus . &quot;
&quot; but you should deal with caution , as the results do not seem very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing a picture re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharply mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades are generated near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable rate of difference . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference therefore for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen and therefore beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted extraction filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique to focus images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus can start from the menu by re@@ focusing color in image editing .
&quot; the g@@ auss &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result of the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Download buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to do all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , Un@@ sharply Mas@@ k@@ ieren makes better results than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , Un@@ sharply Mas@@ k@@ ieren always has to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab@@ s smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
&quot; direction dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD noise , a high value will create wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over every@@ th@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ b effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles make a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the greater quality you get by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; error correction is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or gre@@ asing will occur again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rus@@ hing or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details pane .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ y tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more bol@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjusting of phase j@@ itter cushi@@ oning . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance density . when it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can cause smo@@ kers and phase j@@ itter at the edges . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local fla@@ ws that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture repairs . the texture statement is performed with another tool , the error correction , and the restoration algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make it exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ au@@ ration can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; photo rest@@ au@@ ration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button End . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie gran@@ ul@@ arity on the faces .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo rest@@ au@@ ration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo that has been scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the dark button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you take the dark picture directly into the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate obsc@@ ure to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &quot; &quot; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ op &quot; &quot; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by allowing the light to reach the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which can be used to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should , also with center filters , use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects can be caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and the gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw surface without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction converts the transformation using a center filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous thickness and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ ding correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ dient . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth gra@@ dient . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the inver@@ ted flag of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thereby causes a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
brigh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values during the next start . &quot;
&quot; the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one . if you make a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect obviously would be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the tri@@ mming tool in the Edit menu , or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film from the G@@ ino@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters : movie gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ul@@ ture if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows become white as snow !
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ et applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the spot@@ lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter film gran@@ ul@@ ator is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your pictures . it is known from classical high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless ambi@@ ance loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie gran@@ ular effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and the five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . strai@@ gh@@ tens the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom j@@ uts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ code ; filter engraving determines your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped into wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button End .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom Sh@@ ut@@ ure : blur@@ ring the image along star@@ ry lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) , which is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ in@@ sharp@@ fe : blur@@ ts the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button End .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops to your image . it gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image . &quot;
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning it into the correct orientation . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the size of the tool . choose transformer size change in menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ b effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . each single installation for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button End . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blowing by increasing a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo , simply press the rect@@ angle with the mouse , press the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply clicking on the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button &quot; &quot; C@@ trl + X &quot; &quot; button of the editing pane and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File save under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the width of the width is allocated . &quot;
&quot; cutting After aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo papers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically centr@@ alize the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog below , you can set the range for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio , it saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the tri@@ mming tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image data are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the setup help settings allow you to hide aids , so that you can put your images together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third gel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
golden center : the golden center is a division that on different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; compared to the third gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that guides the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the golden spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can place a static object dynam@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al options mirror and vertical mirr@@ oring can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cap ; image editing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Press module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Automati@@ cally cro@@ pping . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; enter your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ utter@@ ing produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sc@@ aling , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions and edit it . in the configuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found at Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ cap . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ code . hereby more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw data formats provided by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display films or edit . if you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback . &quot;

&quot; if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description will follow here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ ly quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal sharing without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and drop to the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties display the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Char@@ ac@@ ters : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires your images to contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ ettes Files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; ch@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder by files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described below the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Ad@@ m cursor is enabled under the Color button , the color is inserted from the colour panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created in such a way as in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; edit &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if therefore three figures are in the clip@@ board , they can be past@@ ed as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color choos@@ er on the left side .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are model@@ ed according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ phs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; makes ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ not viewer ; in a plac@@ ard ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool and dot ; for the representation of the graphs . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher , without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ not viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ not viewer ; file , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ pher , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and change later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph appearing on one page should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;

&quot; here you can select among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , layout algorithms . entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for executed graphs . it produces representations according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ one Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid solution for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides the tools to read and save new images .
&quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image here . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by adding the default duc@@ r@@ st &apos;s default values to your needs . view the preview and customize the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . &quot;
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image will appear . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore generates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 by saving the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots can be created after selecting the Import &gt; screen shot in the Edit - &gt; screen shot . a window will appear in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
&quot; select The complete Desktop , read in to read a single window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete Desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long a screen@@ shot is to wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world that show photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the export module for Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is thus your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started twice , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access permissions that the module displays . to upload you need write permissions . the module currently supports no other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions . &quot;
the button Add photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
&quot; the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words , which are added to the image as keywords during upload . &quot;
&quot; with the Public Off@@ ices , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation at this moment . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the geographic location of the K@@ IP@@ I module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keyword in the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead to a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above to see dialog appears . to perform a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera calls must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction . if the deviation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ er and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the correct data . if you know that a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ related button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a series of photos in the same place . as the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually between the map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to mount the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML page con@@ forming to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are supposed to be exported to HTML . you only need to select those albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option for each image creates a gallery in which each image opens a page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder where you can write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth set , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after startup , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at this moment . if you are interested in writing them please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under bare @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English .
the metadata editor K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list from the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any destination format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the sli@@ deshow .
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the images you want to pack into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the MPEG slide show by creating the module . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re @-@ select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display an image . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the film . after you have adjusted all your settings to your wishes , you can start using the code encoding the generation of the film . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or quietly and enjoy the sli@@ deshow once you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button at the bottom . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later , you should not select the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . a preview however is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images you selected . you can add more images via the button . for the selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the image list and drop them to add the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after selecting all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments . &quot;
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and sent to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically to allow you to view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions about how to display your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; Open@@ GL passes in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will appear in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually stop using Es@@ c .
the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . therefore it is not used the order of the images in the album .
&quot; between the images , the distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance will depend on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select another effect for each transition between the images .
&quot; while sli@@ deshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation at this moment . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the image , are now available in each group , so in individuals , places and in group keyword entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are displayed are displayed . by using this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to view images beside the names , select the button on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable image for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the Picture @-@ View window ( described in detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the check window , you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the check window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you call the search in the main window , a dialog will be displayed which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can either be a part of the total file , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , images on which Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of photo@@ album ; try it . &quot;
if you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this bar here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays data about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will preview only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file that is to be seen on the overview page . you will find information about the export files in . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer without any description . for example , all images are exported from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . this means those who look at your website and have a monitor , which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , which results at a lower transmission time . if you want to see an image larger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all of your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . in order for the import function , see , correct , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are just described have all three based on base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , the name of which you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file , which can import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the images to the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view via the File Ex@@ porting ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; for manually copying the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automati@@ cally copy to .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not possible to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select what images you want to import into which folder the import images to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is stored in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to navigate within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will complete the various steps from ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual we talk about images , but often this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , i.e. another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained the various settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access to the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
you can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list of the categories you want to configure , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . next information can be found on the Ki@@ pi website . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used together from multiple applications together , it can be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little is tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using it on your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which can be that some modules work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this way an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order by albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply fits the current view , so all the pictures that you see the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have chosen people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you see at the top a menu and a toolbar . under the toolbar you can see the window that you can browse your image database . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture where the image was taken . for example you can either individually or for a larger number of pictures you can set certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
&quot; all these notes may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by defining characters , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by means , that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and arrange them more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to display an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add those images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and drop it there to add this entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a window by dra@@ gging it out of the window area .
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and click here / out . this process will show you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the image in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have not set filters . one example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the preview pane . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete Sel@@ ection from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures without saving you on your hard disk . of course , you have to have the pictures stored somewhere , with it &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut is not saved on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so you can preview these images . however , you cannot view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and paste files from the folders . if so , it doesn &apos;t support you to insert the CD . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid merging your images , please buy a larger disk to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you un@@ available for others click the View menu in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also use all the images that your little sister can see and use the menu item All out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have set which images to be hidden in case of case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the slide show images to hide . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to for@@ bid the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; managing and spending hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . this can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the picture but additional information you have to enter via the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether to display information at all . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selecting people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as sli@@ deshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply move a rect@@ angle with your mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the image . shows how a Zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be shown zo@@ omed . with the Sync button sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming are with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can indicate a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this case you will see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have attributes to your images , these are available in the browser . you can see this in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you show categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the character after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painting later . &quot;
&quot; in order to disable painting mode by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or reject the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can invoke the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties view . &quot;
&quot; press on preview in the properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse over the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as the wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window configuration or if you need another configuration , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the connection to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map series at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window layout is floating point views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to lo@@ osen a view from anch@@ oring , drag the anus to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window ordering ... saving it . a dialog will appear where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon rendering in the toolbar or select the View scene view . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full @-@ size images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box below and enter the image cut@@ out to render into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the quality combination , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image is rendered with a beam of only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or gra@@ ding effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally images with this property look better .
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adap@@ tiv @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is always further divided and adapted because the rec@@ ess depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which will be followed separately and checked for further sub@@ division . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for rendering quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import File menu ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder &apos;s folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the objects shown , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross High Con@@ fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two sel@@ ectable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show floor tiles , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern from two sel@@ ectable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window definition section , it explains how to create and save window orders . &quot;
the default window configuration panel : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new configuration with the Add button , and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window layout . new views can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with window card you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you receive only one black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
if you do not insert lights your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window configuration : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but be aware that the camera in the view has control points to change the destination of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; pressing the App@@ den button or the Enter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( In@@ sert End Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ den button or the enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , even if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree closely , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens , where you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment will then appear in the properties tree ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the preview button , you can see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview shows only a matt black material because you still have to enter the pigment settings . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should already be able to perform this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has moved over the floor as you have moved the bottom to one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection process already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render is calculated as this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently undo command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back .
saves the current window configuration and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you can find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts , and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tools for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image then the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ n show ; set up that only a few of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
res@@ ize the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
show photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; quot ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list to join . &quot;
&quot; a show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show photo . to access these settings , you need to select in the menu settings show@@ photo ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicator area , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show photo shows a side bar at the right edge , providing you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE projection page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options in particular .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and noise will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will be back in the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview should be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way you want to save images . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each image scann@@ ed . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time that is recorded when a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts .
you can set up any existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the necessary modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user does not know why a script does not run . &quot;
terms require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . usually the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . now , the script could ask for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) with D@@ CO@@ P functions . &quot;
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is selected . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ menus item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends and Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right away .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you may have some play@@ lists already , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to recre@@ ate your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok Springs one has to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements Diag@@ nosis section . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several learning flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window will be shown ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
&quot; tun@@ er bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; create an atmospheric effect : this function is only available when you compiled Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme for the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer will be changed . &quot;
&quot; lay mood files with the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list by clicking , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the play , that the playlist window opens / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changing to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by tag@@ ging your own fonts , the otherwise gray section will be activated . you can select fonts for the following section : playlist window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . &quot;
&quot; resume playing when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play continues automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear on .
the box audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this cardboard card .
the collection card collection will be used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder to the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up , as should be done with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the inter@@ sec@@ ted and their sub@@ folders are searched for music . &quot;
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , there will be a port : the network port where the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m board contains the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , in order to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library too days . you can locate the file by clicking ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
most of the time this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will crash when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ play / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects will be forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then please check whether Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems are best explained by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error there , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface , the start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras stat@@ s . &quot;
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Show evaluation . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it down there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , it really is ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types are supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ wise reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , enter key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the tool has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media needs to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bare _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes down &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . &quot;
&quot; read the Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before going to bed then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to find out what is currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you an interpreter and title of the ongoing piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and User@@ name with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the click order into the queue . by pressing the enter key after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search will be reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , use files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &apos; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , the F@@ ROM statistics &apos; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; this is basically the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each evaluation has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing : review rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to know when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not to be combined with the short @-@ term target of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . choose Settings toolbar ... and take the required changes there .
&quot; download a design down , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser Design , click New Design Inst@@ all .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control of Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . run Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information being sent to which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install these output modules .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; you probably need a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output type the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supported m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . you can of course welcome this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed car@@ er for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you wish to update your collection later or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . &quot;
&quot; create a playlist is very easy . drag your mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection facilitates the search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them using the button playlist to save it . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you &apos;ll be in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in order to play an audio CD , please choose Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Br@@ ennen function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including creating a collection and a playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below , the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch to the area by clicking the left mouse button . &quot;
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also shown below the running text display . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . using the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that there is no other player . however , don &apos;t let the abundance of features deter , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information displayed in the statistics window can also be viewed ( Extras stat@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the current piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z @-@ Symbol you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats are .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g . the images can also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using written scripts . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First of all , the pieces are arranged according to the artist . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; artist / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . in the section to the playlist , refer to the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the search filter contains a selection field , which allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
tune pieces to queue - This feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
&quot; on Media @-@ Player , add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialogue for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
&quot; when you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; compilation selection - Chan@@ ges a record marked as a composition back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer under Vari@@ ous performers but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; also created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden that do not meet your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter , for example , tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can become helpful by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter characters , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose gli@@ des : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field does , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all the pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the trl key and clicking on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist pieces . &quot;
&quot; next , you can undo and restore buttons . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as shown in the player window above the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking the mouse into the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visualization plug @-@ in . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can select what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece to the queue , the playlist will appear in the list next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
you can also easily add the pieces in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in queue management .
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( details for setting up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ robat ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Lo@@ ad . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two previously set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the list Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece to your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , check the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated via the same menu entry . &quot;
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . after that , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the previously played pieces will be removed while the tune is set . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously increase because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the Settings on the right side has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package for installation . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also fetch new scripts directly from the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . then select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plugin is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in simply activate the check box next to the name .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when deco@@ ding to MP3 , you can get worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
&quot; this Quick Start should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this or something like that : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC cannot find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules do not find . to fix this problem you start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the library search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run @-@ through ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ records . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them onto an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; normal : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixes of CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown to select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call File Save for each project .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and editing . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , which should happen , just as if you were called for each project file closing . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you click the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the &quot; &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the right mouse button . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multiple session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project .
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD which you can then burn later on . also , the target medium is large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the contents will be completely deleted . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the Bur@@ n button .
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used in general . it contains information about the video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting of black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of toolbar items from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view will display an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drive . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selection and drag of files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ect@@ view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the mapping to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . with this you can set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial to which the accompanying programs give you a preference . &quot;
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following on the console :
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ res@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void nam@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void release assets ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void release Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ pri@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on your computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders which enco@@ des these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . simply avoid buying a copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually captured . &quot;
this is just a short list of main commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how to use this program as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
&quot; CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the configuration of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the tab code settings in the setup directory - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der in the tab code settings has been configured in the setup dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ots ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; quit ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main execution dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here , you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and car oster@@ ones . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely top quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and also the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the installed in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has verified the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for that ; if you want to know more about it , look in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and hence the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) are located on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and read@@ ability on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame have to be installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you own write permission ( eg by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something which is probably done only once . &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each recording &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . because we are lazy we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them for each reading of a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading programme so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left as shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; select only with incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the board card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet during the reading of the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not work . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card board . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls re@@ boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to send a &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number simultaneously : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk is running . we will create the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk . first , connect to the Internet as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually input , instead of getting them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not been done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted in the drive specified in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this is not done , check the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you did not select the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments for each piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and to only 28 characters for the comment field . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
warning : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BO@@ M list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in this way are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the button Sel@@ ection of the reading process started , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you see this error message when trying to work with a enco@@ der that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have read access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding are done in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at persons comp@@ iling from source files and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help and how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point like it should go on from that empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended to be the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need those information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , which others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing colors , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be moved to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
&quot; if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the toolbar , select the item from the menu item or press the Space key . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you click the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after another . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving to and off with the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display to change the playing speed . to restore the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , such as a print on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; ch@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . however , if you select the Automatic Text selection in the Settings menu , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; in case you want to set up an event type , select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in series after . in this section , how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find them in the menu collection under the heading Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the items listed in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection takes all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it again appears in the file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if auto Add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu of the order order sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the &quot; &quot; Previous piece &quot; &quot; button , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter since it is not saved when leaving . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right piano in the events of the type change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . but this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun fire . to do so , you can enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file should now play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ ences ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the word &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ words are mainly used to map sounds onto the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that try to change the patch on that channel will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if so , a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event sends with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pres@@ ets that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view the view in the Settings menu under the View channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because it has been compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and drag the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a mi@@ di / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me under friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money for it . I want to emphasize that I only want to program further because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch ,
&quot; and of course , my thanks also apply to all these outstanding musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid may also be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you cannot hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu Book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Dur@@ able Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to maintain an additional hierarchy level . if you are looking for an item , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and select the next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ set , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after modi@@ fying XML files , you have to choose the playlist from the Edit menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 &apos; option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Player / intro@@ ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; animation during startup needs not be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; In@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; KM@@ player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ player ; . here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ player . here you can see the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
thus the &amp; KM@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages must be the &amp; KM@@ player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file mapping of K@@ DE .
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there is no error here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to test ) . &quot;
&quot; to get a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; S@@ MB Player ; can be played from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device and the TV channels . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port is to be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support for S@@ BR can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux broad@@ ening for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internally by S@@ MEs , different names are used by S@@ MEs . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource . if enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there evidence how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is called root after the device is installed . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts up slowly but why should I check my CPU for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ d.@@ k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; kick .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional sc@@ roll@@ ment application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used for the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the GNU / Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . they enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact over the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile PHP , please refer to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about posters and its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted at K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of posters .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La Mo@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; as well as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ } { document } . &quot;
the Quick Intro@@ duction Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers several options for creating the document . you can also make some specific settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : this specifies the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; scroll &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , author &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; promot@@ er &#93; , or user defined . &quot;
encoding : hereby the character encoding is set . the character encoding of the system should be used . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; lat@@ ex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is a great likel@@ ihood that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . &quot;
&quot; with automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; box , automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for the sake of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document sub@@ division into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files , the search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI file has been created , it jumps &amp; box ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when searching for a box in the DVI file , the elements of the DVI file are plu@@ gged and as soon as an element in the DVI file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &quot; &quot; lat@@ ex &quot; &quot; is cli@@ cked to the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master Document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is located on the n@@ der@@ esp@@ . it is &quot; &quot; a@@ woke , &quot; &quot; and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after mounting . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be visible . the selection fields have been developed for the quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick incorpor@@ ation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the Other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , notes or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or a different element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select from a selection field possible ) .
when using quotation a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; box ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ er@@ e is used for the definition of the font . it can be defined the font for the main text , the notes , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; box , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand from the bottom . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the push button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically performs the storage .
&quot; failure to compile the document , should be searched for errors in logging . when using fast construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the Scriptures is created and only a few words should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , then create a description of the letters inside the environment , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ ge &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , li@@ pos@@ u@@ ums , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . , can be added either by the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } recur@@ sively .
\ \ quot@@ a : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; following the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex code , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; &quot;
&quot; once a little text has been entered in the wizard , a few adap@@ tations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to do this , a quote , a few passages in the bold and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document is viewed , the editor &apos;s view or C@@ trl e can be returned to the editor ( by the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script file ; / PDF file . just try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script , / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows to convert the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex , the conversion can begin in different formats using the button in the toolbar . &quot;
the search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . for this , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le has to be set up ... Tools Building will be selected . &quot;
&quot; to execute the search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked onto the search button . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer is then executed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; box ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do so &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece set up ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using fast construction of the &amp; DVI file , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file declares the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the heads of the La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis between errors . the log file always indicates the error in logging and &amp; box ; ski@@ ps to the fla@@ wed line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . &quot;
&quot; custom users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by the input in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } . &quot;
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can choose your own template rather than the standard one . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex files . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and searched for the steps described below .
&amp; box ; used as internal editor . &amp; Plac@@ ers ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be done in the Tools directly from &amp; box ;
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to experience its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted at K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of posters .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex and its syntax . &quot;
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ s only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different types of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can show additional jumping marks within the text . in doing so , this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le &quot; . &quot; although already excellent options offers , have been added in &amp; box ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code added . in Edit select , the following commands for text selection are included : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . with a paragraph here is not a text with transparent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also called &quot; &quot; lat@@ ex &quot; &quot; ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be completed first and removed by pressing Del@@ ete key . &amp; Plac@@ er ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted areas of ambient commands , the panorama view can quickly be lost . this command will close the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands , which correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
with this command is spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the sw@@ inging bracket .
with this command is spra@@ yed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many sh@@ aded welded groups cl@@ amps it is possible to get lost quickly . this command close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple signs are used as a sign . for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; box ; the sign &quot; for two simple directions . also for the ending of the grace the sign &quot; is used . &quot;
this automatic insertion of the double addresses can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ German or French ) , and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when Shift ; Enter key , enter a smart new@@ line . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a new@@ line but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , shell &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close new@@ line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ surroundings and thereby order all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . when Shift is Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; posters ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; box ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still extended . there are three different modes on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by means of the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the press key , the last character of the input will be removed and will be er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously distorted . on the other hand , the list may also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . of course , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , drop marks may be added to these positions , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible using the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ st jump brand and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le , can be done to make adjustments to these lists . it can be used to select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as books of general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling full @-@ action mode over the menu item , complete surroundings or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically m@@ illed and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient operation can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as the box is concerned , a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; error can be done to these lists . this mode uses the list of full @-@ object mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le . as an example of a drop down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word &quot; &quot; full @-@ space &quot; &quot; is introduced using the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; great access books are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many designers are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete compensation for all already written wishes . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be completely de@@ bit@@ ed . here , the tres@@ hold can also be specified for displaying the full damage . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics design makes the inser@@ ting of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new configurations of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script files and then converted to a PDF file using ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are grouped together in the menu Cre@@ ate compilation , Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ating View . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file in a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Con@@ figuration command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when using the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows you to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script co@@ ders . the scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts have not yet been developed yet , and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
first of all you have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly well @-@ designed system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex works . as this is a very large document , it is divided into three key book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents supplied with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all to &amp; box ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; node ; working area environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which can be done on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who seek to continue the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random sign@@ atures or daily sign@@ atures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the sign@@ atures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random sign@@ atures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many sign@@ atures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sign@@ atures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty sign@@ atures ; in the sign@@ atures section , click the &amp; lt ; empty sign@@ atures ; and add your new signature in the lower section . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file save or click on the Save Disk icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then , you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button at the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ b ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all call pile elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot;

&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows me pro@@ c and how amazing it is . do we pick it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the an@@ gled working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said before , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then it can be easily checked . if not , delete the file under current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er file . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , filed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start using the Edit menu . this dialog opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all of the included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , you can use this path to search the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another benefit by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the project and closing the project , so that later on how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , Events can be created , edited , and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how this ladder is set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter notes is simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text can be entered .
&quot; notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nick@@ name of the first name of the team member is , role play a role in the project : &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive but spaces around brackets and the names : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic , and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends across some pages that are treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means , attributes are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; update the start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default setting can be restored using button default .
&quot; standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regularly creates backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editor or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings to the default next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning alert area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change . it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and structure tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be adjusted automatically . empty knots are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are such , where there is no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most well known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
ad@@ ress : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
loading Compon@@ ent in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
currently there is only one plugin available to add support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view in which all the stopping points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . normally appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger is made if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , the execution continues . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include it is fla@@ wed . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how to help you to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility make of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbol @-@ oriented lad@@ les of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions to insert more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tions@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool@@ bars allow a fast paste of tags to a document without the risk of a sp@@ elling error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( Family 2 only )
valid for the class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for Type method . indicates the name of the class where this method belongs . ( Family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 only ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
&quot; specifies an attribute of a tag . this item can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc . this is an element type element . &quot;
specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current day . &quot;
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each dialog ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an element type .
all tag XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but look for &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ - &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of the work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tool dialog is above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only performed when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file is described ; the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 , encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = U@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with setting actions ... created . click New Action to create the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned , with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to find the script in the following places : $ P@@ AT@@ H / scripts / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables which can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / removed from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance runs , the text is inserted unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output , should be specified by setting the value selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create one &apos;s own toolbar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog when available , so that input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; use 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , means , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called off , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ alized that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there is any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators .
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; save to the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it is created im@@ pedi@@ folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , look now in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently displayed at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at various points there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending tool bar to email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . users can download them . to make an article , we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource you need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , toolbar items toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type definition line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions is all that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from CSS ; -@@ mu@@ ff@@ ers to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply stated , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all cart@@ on , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execute CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area to create a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags on the mouse cursor or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further expansion by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
&quot; the use of toolbar is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert it in your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with anti@@ trust operators are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , complete website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be grouped into three categories depending on which context they are used . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information on a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system , which is oriented to the content , allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus has two cart@@ on at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they are given the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus files on your system . to do so , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . follow , in good application of free software , the idea of why developing what has been developed by someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost any task possible . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ eme , which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; switches the block selection to / off , which allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key . &quot;
goes directly to a line number . this is very useful if your PHP script reports error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script functions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
disman@@ tling and turning the problem porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . -@@ Projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project toolbar . they are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have them assigned to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved by setting actions ... or you will be asked by toolbar items , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , team so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment . &quot;
&quot; enables the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
upload a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; refresh / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied entry by means of toolbar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . click on a activated plu@@ gins will be de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes will depend on the type ; version .
&quot; select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the current document syntax using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you can find details . &quot;
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled in . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the settings of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , no hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can select an exact selection of good man@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or changed to Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the Profile tab , upload high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by using a separate tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub @-@ window , you can switch event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . currently , this behaviour cannot be affected . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select a project ... from the project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows you to select a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if you are closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if you want to save changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project structure supervis@@ es free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the context menu that can be added with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; allows you to remove the current profile . if only more than one profile exists , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent removing . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when you program it . this option is useful , if you need to upload files and save the rather in@@ secure password on the disk . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and uploaded to different servers for the project ( or parts of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are stack@@ able in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is best to create tool@@ bars using the Tools menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the Add tool@@ bars section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , which can be specified in the dialog where it can be specified which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries are additionally removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up toolbar buttons in the Settings menu ... and set Settings to set actions ..
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information about the template tree is available .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specific documents are stored in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area again and again in the documents . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File as template Save As local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this happens , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File as template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click a folder on the right and select a template file in the file tree or in the project file to create a name for the template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template as well . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically using &amp; PHP ; design , insert files , or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of them corresponds to one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except for the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder is configured in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless it would be explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , enabling copy of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor , and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source editor if necessary in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green icon indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . pressing F@@ 9 enabled this mode to move the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta ... After selecting V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast machines and a large dispens@@ er for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; Editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding . &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom . a click on the list allows the change of content such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is as usual in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . the mark works as usual . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the tool@@ bars , such as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing tags cannot be removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , each other must be dropped anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the She@@ et Assistant or the Listen Assistant , are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to compile without &amp; k@@ de ; the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , the orph@@ aned point points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified model name will be verified . &amp; eg ; template matches with each QNA@@ P@@ template containing the template template . &quot;
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point needs to be dissolved for the UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while merging .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed rows , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 , could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparative windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ f@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while merging :
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; also helps with comparing and merging whole folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check co@@ ders , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows are only different in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
C@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 folder Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2
&quot; the Open Di@@ alogue enables manual typing of file names , selecting via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the folder Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing and merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 ; file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to set a output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparative window .
&quot; what idea is there ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : at the moment , you cannot extract and extract anything . only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparative window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into another program as cutting and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small utility window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that is in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line of broken lines is scored . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparative window ) also has an info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; text &amp; lt ; She@@ et Conf@@ lic@@ t ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , end , C@@ trl @-@ Beg@@ inning and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / C@@ trl @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and skip the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use track reset + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ending of the source files , so you should not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; Prin@@ ter Setup ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered more ast@@ ly . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically introduces an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual to the clip@@ board then falls into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a track record &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , others save only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . normally ignore &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the car return sign , however , may be disabled as a white character . during merging this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; this option is disabled in default . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
this option is disabled by default . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
&quot; the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before proceeding to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white signs are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details see documentation for directory comparison and merging .
&quot; if a file is saved and an older version already exists , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit and restart the current program so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for encoding , a short notice appears what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
disable this to supp@@ ress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see differences between two of three files . but sometimes you may want to see only differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply blend the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; arrange the comparison window next to each other or overl@@ apping , this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
sometimes view the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . merging current file in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files . a simple click will start the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only during line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processing command for line comparison to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword er@@ generated text $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line matching . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ aliz@@ ations from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to process a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders with &amp; k@@ f@@ 3 . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without real@@ ising it
&quot; performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ f@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical , if their entire contents is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ c@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and when the option of synchron@@ izing directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the option to select new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examine &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the date of the files , but the same date will display error : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file after the other is processed . you status column shows he@@ ap if the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . when merging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ user will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected item ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge Mode , B will be used as target , in the two @-@ folder merge B will be chosen as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid coher@@ ence actions caused by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the bad elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , you can restart / continue directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 will continue ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry , or to solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been combined individually , you notice &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again during subsequent merging of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ users ... ) now has a section called directory merging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . the default plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that are ignored by CVS too . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folder and searched for recur@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding Anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
enables synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results from merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
&quot; if there are differences , copying the newer file is suggested as an action instead of merging the newer file . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal merging of single files , not just merging whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view will remain visible to merge single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the directory and text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge . to do so , use the current file together from the Mer@@ ge menu . to do so , use the current file together from the Mer@@ ge menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change of change . therefore , permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then de@@ file &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 ; the patch program to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; runs as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name &quot; &quot; K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 &quot; &quot; already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL softwares for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or have to go this way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably did not know the proper pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ nu@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . &quot;
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
&quot; you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly fl@@ ushed ; No sr@@ c has left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ f@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ not 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; there &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de mailing list . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; show differences only : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
this option is de@@ activated in default . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and Be@@ ading . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application will appear as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , View on Desktop and Finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field crosses the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work spaces will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N ra@@ ster , as made from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as icons or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up sel@@ ector selection ... allow dialog settings to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred below as a selection window .
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile lu@@ pin . alternatively , you can make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the settings mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in drop@@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally hold the Shift key , press the Shift key or the &amp; M@@ b ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically use your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and reduction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , as if you use a magni@@ fying glass to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ments . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor stays on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and which each mouse @-@ click prepares pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor leaves for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive strain in the jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click prepares pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this however requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even though it helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this time of residence must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; when switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is down , the mouse button is left before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this function is enabled , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start from &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available in &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be turned off at first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the intelligent slide . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which do not show a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or a f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare cases , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart shift in this case , it means that you can stop the operation by releasing the mouse button anymore . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the mouse @-@ click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . each time you click &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent move starts the move time . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; num@@ b the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor leaves . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , which causes pain to be pressed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text@@ books you can often choose used text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , select the dictionary for the word tran@@ scription . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly sp@@ elled words are included in the word word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have done k@@ mouth , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is attached to the conc@@ entri@@ c memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the word word word and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , you specify the character encoding to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed to the language generator as the default input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the attachment . &quot;
&quot; using t@@ ts@@ d as voice service , say &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the desktop language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered directly into the input field . the chosen text passage is entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; by selecting text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passages book is not saved . select before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages are to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word word dictionary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word processing . in the main window next to the input field , you can display &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then , ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like adding new text passages or books , or del@@ eting selected text passages and books , can be accessed either by selecting from the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text table is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected area of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text table is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected text area will be used . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the process memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is placed directly under the menu bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; when this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the speech output properly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page , and enter the command for speech output on the tab speech output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ech@@ . language output is then possible with one of the following command @-@ examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to split the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
&quot; ( cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v , art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v &quot;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; cons ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the language generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , send text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions is stored , which allows the user to spend time again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . a speech synthes@@ izer has to be installed on the computer .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de , ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ associated mailing list . subscribe to the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ extensions . &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you must install and correct program speech @-@ dispens@@ er . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the board card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map is displayed in General . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . a so equipped combination of speech , synthes@@ izer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card leader Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the board card speaker will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list down one line further down . the order of the or@@ ator in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; pun@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always . go back to the flash@@ card General and check that the T@@ TS service is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts to read text . see .
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the flash@@ card guide General to open this board map . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and you can create and read text orders .
&quot; when t@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and dict@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the Control bar system area when reading , it disappears once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the board card orders are only displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text you want to read and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; outs ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts . then select the text that should be read and select Tools Text from the main menu . then the speech output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if plac@@ ards ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events you have specified . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for the notification are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required . &quot;
&quot; in Fil@@ tering , text is processed before being sent to the program speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as eg , processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning . &quot;
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message breaks up normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every job you send from the board card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the issue of Screen re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; pun@@ ts ; just one such reader reads , this output is stopped and stopped . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string plac@@ eholders replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced may be provided either as words or as regular expressions , which allow the replacing of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery , some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the board card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; k@@ de is sent , it will be edited by all the activated filters that have been set up on the bottom of the page . editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the established normal filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of string plac@@ ements , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these samples are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter matches the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replace . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string substitute filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ce filter if the same . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing notes , the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 , regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can for example specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; k@@ ts ; a text is transmitted to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program pres@@ umes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular and # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it with a click on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ce filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . first start pun@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped over or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ther is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string substitute filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license you can find in the accompanying documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can access the package k@@ de@@ code with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download it . you can also find the source code of k@@ de@@ dom under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above mentioned languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information which is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source code archive for a code or have downloaded the tar@@ ball that is currently created every night , then install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech , which uses the program speech dispens@@ er . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr@@ s should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dispens@@ er is possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , stop or cancel sentences or sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; pun@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Fol@@ der on the board of the board , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the board card will be shown below . for example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you will have to enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; pun@@ ts , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slider controls adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and show them grey , the voice you select doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the ID column on the board card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or return to the order specified in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on the OK button , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and dict@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the box audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; text orders are listed and managed here . issues of Screen re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not displayed . learn more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 % corresponds to about half and 200 % approximately the double normal microphone speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; pun@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M units and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which device works with you . in doubt select the standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important news such as eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message breaks up normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have a long text read on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just steps the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ ader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the issues of Screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts , read k@@ noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; dict@@ ates ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is not read by &amp; dict@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click Add button , a dialog will appear where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to specify what &amp; T@@ ts should do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; when you select Custom Text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the board card speaker as top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be performed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the following noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . furthermore , SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100@@ K , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds start to sub@@ divide text into individual sentences , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of thres@@ holds will be automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add further thres@@ holds filter , but beginners will fall away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the dialog box by trying out . switch off the dialog box and select text for reading . switch off the dialog box , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start faster with reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the board card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal thres@@ holds filter will be automatically set up when you start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation , and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ts ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; if you removed the normal thres@@ holds filter from acci@@ dentally , you can insert it again by loading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the box menu selection , you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the board card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker chooses . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the original set . &quot;
select the method to enter desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is above if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one displayed in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the range speaker , which is most likely to follow the following , click on the default speaker , and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; pun@@ ts ; it &apos;s finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall gam@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I get a text job , it freezes &amp; pun@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts arise at AL@@ SA which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / cap@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / sync the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; there is a setting speed on the board card audio . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze module like Festival Inter@@ active itself offer a setting for speed on the board card for speaker setup . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; dict@@ ates ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very bold , change the edit speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; respect@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta does not seem to work for the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER . thus , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a dedicated string release filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set before or back . on the top of the board , orders are shown , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for character level detection instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read even more . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . &quot;

the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you will need to specify --@@ pre@@ fix = destination as an option . &quot;
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the proper directory for programs that are translated from sources .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text Di@@ phone .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a revised version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the recording of the error correction is not required , you only have to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language of festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust neither pitch , volume , nor speech speed with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions ; search Fl@@ ite as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
&quot; load at least one German language file from the &quot; &quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA &quot; &quot; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder . &quot;
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here you have to remove the r@@ c at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;

&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume in this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr@@ . on the board card speaker click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ OS T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the board speaker . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , open source speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume or speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains how to install and use k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; for the user , create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module Network Set@@ ting ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf to show the device at all and set the network properties settings .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed on installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option &quot; &quot; Network Set@@ ting in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center &quot; &quot; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting No @-@ again questions , the definition can be taken permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the Ri@@ der Network Interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Network Interface Controller :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . by clicking the button , Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the Network mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if more than one network interface is available on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers only accept IP addresses . if the computer asks htt@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .@@ or@@ g. , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed by selecting an entry or listing in the list using the Hin@@ ts or Her@@ under button . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
select one entry from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution and then click the Edit ... button will show the Edit dialog .
&quot; the list of name @-@ known hosts names host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , shut @-@ down networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually the list contains well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Cre@@ ate the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several ali@@ ases names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry from an especially well @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Ready to edit computer is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; install rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of the configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . this app@@ endi@@ x contains only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found any major dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this section you will find the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed by DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally re @-@ sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . a different stand than expected may therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; it appears the standard @-@ node ; print dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced permissions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change user schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX kon@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to save several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
before a tape can be used it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for by opening the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been resolved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band by &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you start format@@ ting tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost . after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files you want to backup . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been taken , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will display settings for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the check settings , the dialog appears check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate recovery , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ compile the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all the files listed under backup files , only the files in the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar , regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection of tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the band will automatically dis@@ connect the tape . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ calibr@@ ated block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need to inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the system is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is designed for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system hides the various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , you will find &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions that can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . will not show you this , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or the entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified , so only log lines will be displayed that match the selected filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the corresponding selected column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process column , and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar ; all the protocol rows that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . log lines of level error are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than log lines of the level indicator . the color representation of protocol rows can be switched off to setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new incoming protocol rows . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;

welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; the system V In@@ it is fast becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts to boot into the Linux world , which is why it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will no longer address historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it file was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are stored in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following more folders : &quot;
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start at startup of the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find the default level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / init@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but what is the start of all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory init@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one contains an K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument starting . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level , which only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level or change position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) .
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you drag them to a new range . to only copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Copy out of the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the product number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : there is currently no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to a different run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ s. and now the machine is constantly changing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also , if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as and eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting to &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a board card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the password management board appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD / Unix . &quot;
&quot; this map only appears if space restrictions ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the array fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
the group of cards informs about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
&quot; the Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , remove and change the boot password , change time to boot the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
