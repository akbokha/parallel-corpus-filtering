<seg id="11">The view filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; Menu bar under Extras View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: this element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists of mapping nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & Unix command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over View Color Mode can either display depth for the easy identification of the merge depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can determine if it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space is available for representation or whether the area of suborderly rectangles may occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses as a frame, that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods are rows, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum presented area for an entry on the View View menu item. instead, a pattern pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry."</seg>

<seg id="74">"modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232)."</seg>
<seg id="75">"Photo2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and are slow transmission over the serial port, this connection is now deprecated. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2."</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digicam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2 you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitized; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiti;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as there may be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digitized; itself."</seg>

<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the icon view currently. thus, the filter on the filename only works if this ind icon view is also displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenliquit quot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & quot; are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they are stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created."</seg>

<seg id="191">"if you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should be aware that it meets UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card."</seg>

<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a licence-free and open raw image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed by DNG because of the need to standardize camera data. a handful of camera creators are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block; -technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata PlatformTags;, a mix of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. however, XMP is able to store metadata separately from the image file. however, it can lead to problems when linking metadata file and image file, and as mentioned above, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put it all there."</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"unfortunately, color management means that you make informed choices at any point of image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make available links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, see Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibriate my monitor if I choose to work in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"whether you're working in sRGB color space or not, you need to callibriate your monitor since sRGB is associated with sRGB. if you are working as a sRGB colour space, you need to callibriate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, comparing, automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Correcise Automatic Correction attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminosity values across the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same method adjusts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. this results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram."</seg>
<seg id="393">Extend contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the upper right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance to the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance you set can be saved to a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image can be set here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of shell images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Coloring Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so you always have the same error and you always need the same correction. you will find more information in the manual on tone correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitized; Tool Farming Effects provides you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a filter filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was called" "Sabatier", "an effect that was created by replacing a partially developed pressure with a short flash beam and afterwards the development of the image completed. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solaris effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquot" "effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a color film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonlight simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than raise it. all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the instrument tone correction is used to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the sliders for the application described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into the pane and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control knob and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can see the original and the preview of the image. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear history is most useful. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the mid tones, often called gameplay."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pin titles can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to interactively edit output values as in the input values. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp Levels Format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools to focus. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it does not sharpen a bit, it rather works psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitised images require correction of sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already use a focus filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the focus."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with caution, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening a picture refocus the tool. under refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to softer with the menu entry Correcise softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharply masking is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grenades are generated near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable rate of difference. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference therefore for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocussing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique to focus images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred mask. refocus can start from the menu by refocusing color in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the gauss's fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result of the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Download buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to do all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, Unsharply Maskieren makes better results than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, Unsharply Maskieren always has to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the blurring. for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened, in order to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie granularity or CCD noise, a high value will create wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over everyth. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulb effect it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles make a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step distance [0,1, 10]: integrated stride length in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the greater quality you get by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>

<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can blur the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or greasing will occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rushing or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamy tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more bolstered."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjusting of phase jitter cushioning. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance density. when it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can cause smokers and phase jitter at the edges."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the softener with the menu entry Correcise softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>

<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters: movie granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granulture if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows become white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red filet applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digitized; filter film granulator is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. it is known from classical high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film granular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless ambiance loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO-sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="601">"the top selects the brush size between one and the five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. straightens the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images of their gradient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the bottom juts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button End.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">"zoom Shuture: blurring the image along starry lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates blurring a zooming camera, creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography."</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurts the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurts the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurts the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect), which is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelinsharpfe: blurts the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button End.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your image. it gives natural your images a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">"as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image."</seg>
<seg id="626">"use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirrors or turning it into the correct orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the size of the tool. choose transformer size change in menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintaining aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulb effect it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose. each single installation for photo magnification can be saved as text file, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo blowing is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button End."</seg>

<seg id="649">"the setup help settings allow you to hide aids, so that you can put your images together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic pitches are based on the principle of similarity. like the third gel, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle into a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that on different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"compared to the third gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that guides the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also diverge from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object dynamical."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirror and vertical mirroring can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can do this with the & digicap; image editing and the tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Press module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically cropping. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:"</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"enter your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two shuttering produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the scaling, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformers cut out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized."</seg>

<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later, you should not select the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. a preview however is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="881">"after selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and sent to the mail."</seg>
<seg id="882">"the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossfree formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format."</seg>
<seg id="883">"if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent."</seg>
<seg id="884">"when the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically to allow you to view the status messages, searching for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end."</seg>
<seg id="885">"after starting the Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions about how to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album."</seg>
<seg id="886">"OpenGL passes in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the filename of the images will appear in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually stop using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select pictures randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. therefore it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">"between the images, the distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance will depend on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!"</seg>

<seg id="921">"last but not least, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer without any description. for example, all images are exported from a party."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. this means those who look at your website and have a monitor, which supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can search your images with low resolution, which results at a lower transmission time. if you want to see an image larger, it changes to higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all the images to the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kin file either directly from the File menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file looks for the images in two ways. first, it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view via the File Exporting..."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>

<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy to .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not possible to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category Persons of the importing file (if you are a domain), while this category is stored in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories match them in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to navigate within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, which can be that some modules work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this way an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order by albums so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"it simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply fits the current view, so all the pictures that you see the picture preview at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">"if & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if an image is rendered with a beam of only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or grading effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects to & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptiv-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is always further divided and adapted because the recess depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray uses a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which will be followed separately and checked for further subdivision."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; and also the information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for using freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the installed in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org provides an up-to-date list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to store in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used for that; if you want to know more about it, look in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read WAV files, the encoder and hence the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are located on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welter Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and readability on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flc & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"cdparanoia and lame have to be installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software."</seg>

<seg id="1547">"the first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator, something which is probably done only once."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD, which needs to be repeated for each recording & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy we share the program with the freedb to download the data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them for each reading of a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not work. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card board."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"for example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which sounds similar to a gun fire. to do so, you can enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file should now play a note with patch 127 (defences), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the word" "drum patch" "is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map sounds onto the percussions channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that try to change the patch on that channel will be ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently displayed at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at various points there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) sending tool bar to email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>

<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource you need to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start clicking OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD packet (DTEP) menus, toolbar items toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML-languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format could be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars over actions is all that is marked globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from CSS; -muffers to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply stated, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2087">"you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all carton, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execute CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right click in the editor area to create a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags on the mouse cursor or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>

<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information about the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specific documents are stored in appropriate subfolders. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template, but the same text area again and again in the documents."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus."</seg>

<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File as template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions for it, such as dragging and dropping or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"you can click a folder on the right and select a template file in the file tree or in the project file to create a name for the template. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template as well."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend headlines and footers or dynamically using & PHP; design, insert files, or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of them corresponds to one of four types of container as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2212">"this is enabled by default and fits all except for the master folders in the template overview. if a root folder is configured in such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless it would be explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">"this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project, enabling copy of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footers."</seg>

<seg id="2215">"& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor, and the second will divide the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source editor if necessary in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green icon indicates the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the VPL; Editor and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. pressing F9 enabled this mode to move the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronization interval between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Quanta... After selecting VPL; view, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast machines and a large dispenser for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL; Editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding."</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom. a click on the list allows the change of content such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta-elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>

<seg id="2225">"inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbars, such as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags in previously existing tags cannot be removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, each other must be dropped anchor tag."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & knu3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed rows, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & knu3, could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparative windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kf3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& knu3; also helps with comparing and merging whole folders. this screenshot shows & knu3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& knu3; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check coders, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if rows are only different in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Cdiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 folder Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the Open Dialogue enables manual typing of file names, selecting via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the folder Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing and merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, then use & kh3; file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to set a output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & knu3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialog, you don't need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what idea is there? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at the moment, you cannot extract and extract anything. only the drop-down of text into a comparative window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into another program as cutting and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small utility window will show the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that is in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line of broken lines is scored."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparative window) also has an info line with the inscription:, the filename and [changed] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons for the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"in the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / last difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and skip the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors do not use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use track reset + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ending of the source files, so you should not use binary files."</seg>

<seg id="2331">"this option is disabled in default. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled by default. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in automatic skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before proceeding to the next unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful if white signs are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details see documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">Change the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to quit and restart the current program so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries."</seg>

<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see differences between two of three files. but sometimes you may want to see only differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply blend the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">"arrange the comparison window next to each other or overlapping, this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes view the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. merging current file in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files. a simple click will start the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kh3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only during line comparison. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line comparison to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically created strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword ergenerated text $\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line matching. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the realizations from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details differently. where used\\ (and\\), perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system hides the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">& ksystemlog; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence attempts to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the format of syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, you will find & ksystemlog; functions that can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup, try & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open. will not show you this, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or the entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified, so only log lines will be displayed that match the selected filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the corresponding selected column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process column, and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar; all the protocol rows that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. log lines of level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color than log lines of the level indicator. the color representation of protocol rows can be switched off to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new incoming protocol rows."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further up-to-date information about the sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is fast becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts to boot into the Linux world, which is why it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will no longer address historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init file was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are stored in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysit and the following more folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start at startup of the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find the default level 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but what is the start of all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one contains an K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument starting."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level, which only runs httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not trivial: just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runlevel or change position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you drag them to a new range. to only copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy out of the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the product number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to a different runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runlevels. and now the machine is constantly changing. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are started simplifies configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also, if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as and eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrect."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting to & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double-click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space restrictions (quota) for users, a board card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the password management board appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD / Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this map only appears if space restrictions (quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem) is activated and initialized for at least a built-in filesystem space limitation (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the array filesystem with space limitation.</seg>
