&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the Supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was like this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived in , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as it is said so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party had ever achieved . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s world@@ view did not correspond with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Basi@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp beg@@ ged his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp elec@@ torate as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an in@@ capacity to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man looking down on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( N.@@ B. Ü ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; pu@@ n from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America did so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise , saying , &quot; Hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices got lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , has a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud NO !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is Tru@@ mp@@ s land now , the news said . &quot;
&quot; all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the common Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central to the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality that is located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
&quot; but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin @-@ made violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about 1 billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est , like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the liber@@ i@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to refu@@ te one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia for pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which inter@@ sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stopping Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime ministers from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden so that it is extremely difficult to track down . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing .
&quot; the deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but during actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions are done in real time , tra@@ ck@@ able at the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishing which inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive th@@ at@@ fish fish@@ eries which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , speci@@ fying imag@@ inary names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You cannot run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to Me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found floating ships .
&quot; thanks to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track the illegal ships that are fond of hiding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i shall help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each individual tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join our neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships which used to be fishing without a license , and were unlikely to face consequences , now know they are being observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since f@@ isher boats are buying more lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also sto@@ cked into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; this is another success for F@@ ISH @-@ i . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular collaborative work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the oceans .

the street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the inauguration of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on its im@@ pe@@ achment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found as well as against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas Strip , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central north of Bun@@ de@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the dis@@ continuation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ operating at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( such as : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass demonstration to support the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the government according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , a number of demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which forms the amount of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s add :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , under@@ took little action against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have occupied critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the Cordoba province . &quot;
&quot; in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that this was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a follow@@ er and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ an officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret services division 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his history shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP systems . &quot;
don &apos;t pass the pass that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - a revolutionary people &apos;s army - the military arm of the Argent@@ ine Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party . &quot;
&quot; that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would be en@@ chanted .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I was looking inside and saw a couch where people were tortured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there .
&quot; they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , shed it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind@@ mill .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched in the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I was among the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were buried and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were several spaces that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed him .
&quot; according to the alleg@@ ations of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the path on which you came here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tors came here .
&quot; looking at the map , you see that they took about this way and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the de@@ human@@ isation process .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be mis@@ placed . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; loo@@ t of war &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
&quot; at that time at age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges , which one attacks an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you walk into a house and steal the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a loo@@ t but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who steal cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you walk so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
this was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover pul@@ lover of wool . my father had both of them from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still didn &apos;t bring clothes at home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence was accused of being a con@@ spir@@ ator at this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can recognize the value of a lifetime . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went as far as to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the corp@@ ses van@@ ish ? &quot;
why kidn@@ ap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have been put in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , something always remains . &quot;
I have seen how you killed people !
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
&quot; the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he responded only &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I replaced the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally testified against my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , in 28 cases sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;

&quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto , &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ appropri@@ ated translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil rear @-@ thought and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 @-@ 20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; adaptation of the original Joshua Lev@@ ine photos , widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who made the local newspapers aware of it . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is appearing in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation come from ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture has ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents is quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors generated 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased over the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter , notably , did not bring comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a genuine translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre bug in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ ride , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still produce translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as ornam@@ ents . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship in the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the port &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; ( Fre@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also contributed recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the duties of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fel@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to requests of specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server answers er@@ ron@@ eous or denied the request for the call of such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witnesses from other crimes that have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted up . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ lla - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated for the Cri@@ adi@@ lla , generally guarantees silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; are handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and whose exploitation is justified by faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred which takes place in seclu@@ sion in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ a@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ented Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a swift investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , but also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign in bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that her still time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house as food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the manager Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition papers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not keep it with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family often because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their mother tongue of Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; a thing that is almost never talked about are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ anes , who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ lla when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;

the society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the inland who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the stor@@ ef@@ ront of the ad switched once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I wonder if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í were ens@@ la@@ ved and the native population had to pay tribute to them and the indigenous population had to go into a system of slavery , in which they become light sacrifices for abuse and exploitation . &quot;

bill of legislation dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
released under the public domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians have recently voted for a bill on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is in order to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register with their correct names and identity card numbers on the site to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users from the telecommunications ministry received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Event for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that &apos;s a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and to lead them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
last year T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was envis@@ aged for those found guilty of den@@ ying &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard from war @-@ drawn Iraq

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs in Nature for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the responsible daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was an extraordinary pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring cities Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture still had a nuclear accident , and alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the victims themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of emergency shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) still tries to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such expe@@ ditions . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who were hau@@ ling after the disaster , were evacu@@ ated to final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fishing har@@ bours are in operation in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian country , have suffered large @-@ scale suffering . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of atomic accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land have been cultivated by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it seems more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys conducted by the local population and under the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees , who still live in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are known to be in real hab@@ itation because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global links are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in man &apos;s artificial coma after he has been kno@@ cked together by the police at nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday a police officer took him over his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; doctors operated on him this Saturday , and now sent him into an artificial coma . &quot;
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a striking stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás stated that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ an@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ an@@ nia , shared the video footage taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs hurry to him shortly . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brasili@@ an re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father because he has supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has hit him with a head@@ stock . &quot;
police kno@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , police officers put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from fighting against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on a different , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo pur@@ pos@@ ely reported about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their titles with a photograph .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a burned bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more on a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Villa@@ ges forgotten by the de @-@ induc@@ ing in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities were la@@ gged in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who opens every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene seems to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not a novel@@ ty anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report issued by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated most , &quot; sc@@ ams . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these are officially recorded documents , which differ only with regard to the parts which would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all had been signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction it helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work char@@ gers has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the employment and services generated in the municipalities where they were located were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had been no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;

sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding since 2004 .

&quot; after two years , the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to interfere , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , and this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were used to spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the provision of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and a clear voice , is not an im@@ patient person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes to retirement with 65 years of age , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do them using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lived in Montreal and worked in Northern Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and worked together with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop promp@@ ts the young participants to discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases were not solved . &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always speak native languages to the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation is recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group who gave them a rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German language : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will forgive our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead of our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributed and adds the stan@@ za to sy@@ ll@@ abled ( which is also published on his blog and is re@@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers will see these plastic meals and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a number of small companies that produce the plastic courts , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend turns them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cold refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food delivery is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we have found a good use as cell phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ coff@@ ees is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter che@@ ating . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic meals can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic meals you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts actually are made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and the killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug trafficking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in such a way :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves according to his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter in what form it occurs : &quot;
I know disease and sensation@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the hop@@ el@@ essness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; wet &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade themselves that they remain unaffected by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family with threats had been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals press money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never goes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy , for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father , which was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8,5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who have not forgotten us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if an image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this entry and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but what &apos;s the year after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its initial release , it has been mis@@ led to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that were actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions to our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car tra@@ vers@@ ed S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank truck came to the victim . &quot;
&quot; representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby which was full of people who watched the football world championship . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered across the streets .
many people were burnt to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it .
but here the story does not come to an end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned . &quot;
only by satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
one step further brings personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely related the image from the DR Congo to sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts resem@@ bled the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claimed by Burma &apos;s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed at last on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the image from DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of what they were published on . by doing so , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers over which examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names a false report but also discusses the mis@@ use of the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme cases of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an slaughter , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a report on what it meant as &quot; pur@@ pos@@ ely fin@@ alised news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this correction , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; fli@@ rt with a tri@@ but@@ ary a catch ? &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , directed at members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was put into circulation later in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dung y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times rescu@@ ed ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ ity Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in Gra@@ u ) also point to Tin@@ Eye but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ u . )

there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent ima@@ gery has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal is equ@@ ated to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how forci@@ ble media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is much to be discussed concerning violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg@@ . insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to provide language enth@@ ou@@ si@@ es a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
these words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ b@@ del@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist persist@@ ently every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Look at your parents in recognition of how they have tried to take care of you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , widely appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite ones here . &quot;

&quot; as Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade , &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tro@@ dden across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion from the Sri Lanka catastrophe centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and close to hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot;
the health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
&quot; floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7,5 m . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood water . &quot;
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ shi@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies destined for the residents in flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ anth@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data using the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the Ro@@ an@@ u Trop@@ ic &apos;s disaster , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to retrieve a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need to security and provide aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , and the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

&quot; approved in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next generation , we will expand rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and humans , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied out of an American flag , others sk@@ imm@@ ing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which have built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mo@@ m me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that , as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in , are being Muslim . &quot;
being Muslim is becoming a Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of it ?
love ?
to be in peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , just as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ integrated the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations domin@@ ating our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality , which in the last three decades has led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even elect their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and forcing Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , these are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it looks at the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought hi@@ erh@@ in with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion are
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Russians .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants who come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ st from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents had been missing Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now absolutely Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting rid of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , whom all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m kid@@ ding , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by the current volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which our already faulty image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ sc@@ arf to a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the United States , see below . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior might not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the br@@ anding view that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is my grandmother &apos;s image mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete pictures painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me to speak when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ alized by a &quot; Empire &quot; which was founded by a company called Hon@@ or Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim lands . &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot bom@@ ber of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ic sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion things go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ mind@@ ful history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name that tells the story four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ars that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders vis @-@ à @-@ vis people from just the countries that are bombing it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which mostly refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we throw off on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University revealed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression , which we move in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I am concerned by this difficult global timing that we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given to them ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who have made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is being made to another . &quot;

but these are no concepts with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , was himself a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of being conscious and unconscious the &quot; others . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , while he is bombar@@ ded by broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; tell stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , stories in their original language are a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , is the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are , to belong to it . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening to often is associated with it , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen &quot; to make sense , to feel , to soci@@ alize . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience is insi@@ sting on it . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the significance of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience who doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for a re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt from the USA
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started in the Dominican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was called by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing debts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held ac@@ countable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding allowance , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state alliance integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law for government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .

&quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements for shared knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from time @-@ to @-@ time extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in prison for Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; however , his residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , G@@ haz@@ i is the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a visiting book that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him , when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It &apos;s done &quot; :
&quot; it happens every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments , &quot;
and laugh and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

basin History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians died in prison . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been demanding the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release back to previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ odor@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other defend@@ ants for the dis@@ mis@@ sal of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose Council was Chief Financial Officer of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who submitted the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedures after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t like the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ zu de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently kept silent and caused no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the media social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contrary to the contrary &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had left off . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is willingly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil , says the Director no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so honoured . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief enters the prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora del Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was above all capable of selling his father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he stopped for 10 years and was released . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he re@@ jects money , puts him again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ kor@@ ean _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ oring many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or mo@@ ck@@ pe@@ as . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took up their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used by ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ okes hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age lens ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( chim@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence of ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet &apos;s opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm doesn &apos;t understand what you write on account .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not pers@@ ist for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting posts , posts and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; stools &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a great deal of sales , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is said to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese side , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the old age is now at the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage network , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ for@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s rights convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the UN Statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , already married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the toe of children - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single vote against it .
&quot; once approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on chil@@ dr@@ ens were finally changed .
&quot; member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has hidden the core of the thing , but do you know what ? chil@@ dr@@ ens are illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , is a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the orph@@ aned age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the proposal for the change of the sp@@ ouses today , on 9 June 2017 , was adopted . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties voted against have voted for the law .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is no longer allowed by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # Refu@@ ge@@ es .
thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention of taking legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to be able to fulfil his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished they would address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters , may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in the advantage of them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the chil@@ dr@@ ens are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the office of the Public Prosecutor Y@@ ar@@ News announced that they were h@@ ack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; through the mirr@@ oring of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the USA , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are defending themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many tech @-@ tra@@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , however , is available in spite of legal restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we all started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs , and washed out colors . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his home town , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just sat at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ res@@ h ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a phone call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran up with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to gr@@ ind the pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , because he was standing with tig@@ ers face to face , saying , &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b itself by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I too was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he begins immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his passion for fo@@ stering Nepal as nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to make photos of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ erg@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of calling their wives also not by name is common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the degradation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage right up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and direc@@ ts those clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to speak out the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never known her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to speak the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only ch@@ ich@@ ing herself , another decided to let out the whole fru@@ stration of him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient br@@ once , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received many reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law gaz@@ ed at her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation ran out of violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the cin@@ der @-@ red dot if he would do it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the club club is a safe place where they can share opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have been wearing only sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of cur@@ ta ( upper shirts ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
so far we have only done small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to tell the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to tell the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ ish on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gle for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the main site in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here soon realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; today , the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves just everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this r@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day will run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different from Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ trafficking , presumably for non @-@ faith purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could steal gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to a mission carried out by the UN in South Africa in 2016 to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to go to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police cau@@ tioned according to the latest murder of three bald men on account of their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; old Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in distress ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like to be ashamed of E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , a country in which people would have shame to go to the street , dressed as if they would not hurt men or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald @-@ headed for super@@ inten@@ tional purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; would aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the director of the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ app@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald : &quot;

we are deeply concerned by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends , and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) , took a key role in expanding public access to Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ hir &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were self @-@ si@@ ders of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ hir &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials discovered that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we pay tribute to the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we dig@@ ni@@ fied the efforts of all those individuals and organisations that have campaig@@ ned for their release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the start of the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have gone missing , the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made just recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Dan@@ ger ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal issue , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told him that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to call for calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; at the end of June , R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and the rest of Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union of the European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as reported in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the message asks the Chinese authorities not only release Li@@ u , but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany and Germany
&quot; German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and the United Kingdom
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China demanded that Li@@ u provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ see the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and the United Kingdom
&quot; in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s foreign ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take it up . &quot;
Taiwan in the future
&quot; the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ ei @-@ nu , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , under@@ signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem foolish , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of the fact that it inevitably appears un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re mer@@ ges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who are preten@@ ding to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden to illustrate his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a land , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our V@@ K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out to the criti@@ ques that one should start reading the full tran@@ script of the conference , so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; as he said Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we were enjoying free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not refer to it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - be I with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , correctly associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian slip ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do they not defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who does our Prime Minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is ten@@ ding and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series dealing with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and showing another fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question most commonly asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan again and again . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began traveling around the world 20 years ago , before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons in our country !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; very often . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means being idle - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( one of his own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can b@@ ump yourself . &quot;
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; it can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main feature of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about fence over the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau served the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada very sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that shows the Jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , as well as the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these photos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; change the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and prosec@@ ute persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict end against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic off@@ ence ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ach@@ ish war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ po@@ ava are in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ brevi@@ ations , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , for the most part Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka@@ kas are symboli@@ cal for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; for each child , Nat@@ asha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money . &quot;
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation revol@@ ves towards the end , a little boy runs over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood that will ensure integrity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez talks , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she does not want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick , she bu@@ ys medication which she cannot pay , she massages the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together , and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards , in order to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have received migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after living for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single executive , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where to go next . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the hall@@ ways , the travelers consult quietly their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen , which she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she briefly presents her .

&quot; on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; police report states that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in the region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and the south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( to be a real er@@ ron@@ ym ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of bondage by the rest @-@ watching technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; X@@ ing@@ ray &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can up@@ lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government , government and party related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of U@@ rum@@ ma@@ i &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Gä@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look up and see that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from within and from outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dissolve into smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of the evil . you realise that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to sm@@ ash the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods sought , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply ceased functioning in the neighborhood .
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my rooftop .
I heard my voice reson@@ ate with the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt courageous enough to gather together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we turned to a gorgeous image that filled my expectations with full satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed the whole way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me also hear you shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were directed at me .
and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my case when I replied : &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice from yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I didn &apos;t regret a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father is equal to that . &quot;
&quot; his father , along with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed s@@ atin is in my nose so far .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I was suspended for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I am showing all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and I am allowed to sit down immediately without waiting for permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the police left the cell and I resor@@ ted to an old tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : strike with the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my table @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking features can be detected in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers denied its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ en on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance , I always hear them shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has to be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are ring@@ ing , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be questioned .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect and prevent state security from us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the close eye @-@ field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this penalty . &quot;
of punishment in all its variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t fall enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables , in order to present us the great invention of a giant cab@@ al from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he interven@@ ed next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole area . &quot;
my naked body lying stretched on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always let me go free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors , sometimes he turns to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ e ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ book music . &quot;
&quot; but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian &quot; second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; &quot; while he poured in water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with a protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the key words speak flu@@ ffy coffee and the check@@ weigh@@ ers of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan made an appearance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms , and is the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which challenges the well @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply asymmet@@ ric rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved traditional men &apos;s men to Lei@@ be , completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently tram@@ pled unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they were supposed to trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , in Jordan , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Mor@@ des &apos; has increased - un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still app@@ alling that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; however , H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , and cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been fool@@ ed to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview to the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only one edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ de , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ da , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service den@@ ounced several former government officials and members of the Te@@ aching Union , with the reason that they have critically reflected on comments in social media about the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing &quot; them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting which A@@ man belonged to as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of Japan &apos;s 3 biggest festivals .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing have been handed down over more than one thousand years , in which armies mar@@ ched from west Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ siv@@ ity . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youths away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair course . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the failed hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dresser &apos;s competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their guns against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice to get training in hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community with love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; love messages to guer@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la col@@ li@@ ación campaign , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal detention for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried arms around the clock must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans joined together and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 Let@@ ters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was created at the summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people , who needed the most urgent response this year . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation moved to the camp to personally over@@ take the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the guer@@ illa fighters camp . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters lived ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty sleep . &quot;
&quot; but I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote me something like that , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I firmly embra@@ ced him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sad to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices for new voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered for a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no voting rights , and realizing that people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; for example , Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ hum@@ ova , whose first publication on the website OC Media took place . &quot;
&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs just like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert above the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen Auth@@ orities that arrested que@@ er que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced from the sexual equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she eventually moved into the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round trip through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I came to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sweat stain@@ s ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and began to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
&quot; OC Media : in which cases , you have been placed - in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he has handled respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
&quot; they posed absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to cope with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only disappointed your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she took a rope around his neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 thread . &quot;
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my human rights guar@@ dians checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it &apos;s number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian items I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who are loc@@ alized ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who imprisoned in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan people were not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there &apos;s not many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives , in order to put themselves in the court of Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for a month and a half .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already well known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but in the end it was thrown back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , bore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never insul@@ ted me .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , was a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ice is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they thought you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period stop ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but above all about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could sense how the people in the city started to change . &quot;
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation worsen@@ ed in the republic . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ff , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food types . &quot;
I don &apos;t get a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded Zu@@ id .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to clear you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ ge@@ ants have which , the Cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know I &apos;m myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he lit up himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors had nothing to do . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Ham@@ id manifest , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all the family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran is based , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy acquired power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran in 1925 . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories , where the provinces meet Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who had a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mo@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ wa@@ zi males . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired , because even Arabic names are not tolerated in the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside .
&quot; for example , women today still earn less money despite the same scho@@ oling than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still pulling cross@@ wise through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , emotion@@ ally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to silence . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injustice in her mind , which refers both to sex and to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimil@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to be silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than engaged in a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and to move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : recru@@ iting : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman , I am recognized as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , bro@@ o@@ ks and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques that help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of cur@@ ator .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman appeared to Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also did nothing useful . &quot;
a few days later the second woman returned her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Imp@@ acts and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , nothing under@@ estimated 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ cology , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . at 70 % of them there was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women came here , too . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; for every woman detained in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she did . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the hard@@ est recognizable : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed it so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; after all , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , they didn &apos;t get any support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Prin@@ ter ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ In@@ credi@@ tors ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to declare and har@@ den the fem@@ ici@@ le as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; the legislative text was changed in a number of ways to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be paved , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence themselves , if they simply want to make an announcement and get a safe shelter to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the offen@@ ders being punished . &quot;
we have to refund as long as abuse is no more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the Section for Recon@@ ci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; to read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and placed in court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had made his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the sole sul@@ tan , he has been the main office in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan is marked by the insi@@ sting efforts by the security forces , in particular the intelligence service , the freedom of the press , including freedom of the press , to torture and to torture independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and encourage citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the paper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; in judicial and judicial decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a succession dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties involve the hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the minister of information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of mal@@ functioning of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state &apos;s prestige . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty beyond the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 Syrian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; a security deposit of 5,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( $ 13 000 ) was set for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the verdict was announced . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; paper .
&quot; despite the court &apos;s decision to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the paper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom .
&quot; further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ att and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) , the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , calls on the authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ checked their lawful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to peac@@ efully assemble , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown by agreement &quot;
&quot; in the media , medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all . this is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious implications in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists itself helps to build its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious impacts on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian National Program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and the Internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are only accessible for payment ( called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India , such as &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers to change global food production &quot;
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ressing , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salad types he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or leaf@@ y leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants , such as cer@@ eal or board varieties . as a result of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food safety are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer , since his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions . &quot;
it is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to thread .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed any new type of salad , because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten the red tube sal@@ at of the &quot; greenhouse &quot; variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested that plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds they have bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; the recent examples of the merger of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which , for example , are offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking because of the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , employed a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mas@@ ked plants like wheat are patented in an even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for gro@@ wers decreases with more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to speaker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company advoc@@ ates the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders , as patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection is not inhibit@@ ing innovation , but fo@@ sters them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on believes it is different : wait for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly grants no innovations . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; altogether , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of using plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants they form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret to nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures whose cultivation requires massive her@@ bi@@ cides to grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders would be more innovative through the avoid@@ ance of plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , with which one makes it very simple in my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also assists them in coming to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and selling their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an open @-@ source license , which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for breeding differ from country to country , so the Os@@ si obligation can not simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which the official launch of the seed should be launched next year . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused above all on where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend at 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above . &quot;
&quot; in August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it severely critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful to its goal , to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these aims , it has never been as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 sites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of the site locks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ .@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles , which he writes for websites and media that are in@@ accessible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is also home to Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video about how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a comment on Facebook , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal J@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; I succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the closure of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courageous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this yiel@@ ded technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , af@@ te also documented the blocking of suppliers through the circum@@ fer@@ ment of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
she reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; daily newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , nav@@ y and air@@ way to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice sum@@ mon@@ ed even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the &quot; Extra &quot; newspaper , known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the motive for their decision was as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . anything that happens from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a weapon of war in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a discourse of war , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mor@@ es per state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media enterprise in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . but for several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ anes and repression against poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an in@@ viol@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
one week it is now that the police declared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime opposite loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside Damascus , causing inhabitants to be dependent on locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled foods through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; to raise money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ um@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting fung@@ i , according to Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Do through Monday , September 4th 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began using the &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms coming from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards they planted a small mushroom grav@@ ey@@ ard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom hus@@ band@@ ry for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower .
&quot; bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia , Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 erup@@ tions in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy occurred where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the area of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; throughout Portugal , in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and anti @-@ fire measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the federal government of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire will be questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the shape of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity from fall to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ v@@ os continues in the same article of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of readily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added to the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants looked for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the own civilian protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed fires , not counting more than half a million requests . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together for the last time with his family at dinner in G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it so , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy should break . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , always came closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him ill . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran , and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum requests , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for an accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ bo@@ unded willingness to live helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans run operations , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Turkish , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
Afghan Enter@@ pris@@ er Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the establishment of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; this way they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road . &quot;
&quot; citizen journ@@ alism : Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in jail for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ate &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the dis@@ approval of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which has been applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or senior officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the law &apos;s proposal , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , thus legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may involve up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the Egyptian police , while using violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on false charges of inter alia ce@@ ase@@ fire , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists listen to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; said plan is provided by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , expressly provides a controversial bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all un@@ lawful preserved mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21st on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources with article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press co@@ dex which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he acted as a witness in the Tunis Regional Court on 0@@ 9th May . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID card ?
&quot; according to the new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
it is also stated in the rules that the registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
will we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat missed to register with the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that provide the &quot; disclosure of information . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ lo Clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has block@@ ade Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block@@ ade in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was blocked because it became &quot; an information source , &quot; which collabor@@ ated with groups in order to appe@@ ase a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop smu@@ g@@ gling
&quot; after a document carried out this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance events that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by the members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
