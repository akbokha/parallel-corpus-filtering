<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the Supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was like this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I have ever lived in, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as it is said so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party had ever achieved."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's worldview did not correspond with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Basiey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump begged his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost the heart broke."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump electorate as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an incapacity to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man looking down on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(N.B. Ü): as much as" white against all other ethnicities, "pun from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America did so splendidly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise, saying," Hell with diversity, freedom of religion, and the whole concept of pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices got louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, has a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud NO!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is Trumps land now, the news said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the common Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality that is located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hopelessness."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero the children of Cateura are playing - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about 1 billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest, like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the liberiian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to refute one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "all of a sudden, the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia for plundering the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which intersects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO stop Illegal Fishing (stopping Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime ministers from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden so that it is extremely difficult to track down. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing.</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate contempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but during actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions are done in real time, trackable at the FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishing which invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive thatfish fisheries which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, specifying imaginary names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say 'You cannot run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to Me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found floating ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"thanks to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal ships that are fond of hiding."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information. FISH-i shall help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organisation: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each individual trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join our neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships which used to be fishing without a license, and were unlikely to face consequences, now know they are being observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fisher boats are buying more licences."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also stocked into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"this is another success for FISH-i. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular collaborative work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London, where she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything was possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I was looking inside and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, shed it with water and chased him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was terrible... like a dirty windmill.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and were wearing eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people crouched in the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I was among the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," Why have you brought me here? ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were buried and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, there were several spaces that were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed him.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the allegations of survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera trial, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the dehumanisation process.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be misplaced."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'loot of war'</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>

<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence was accused of being a conspirator at this crime. I replied, no problem, they can burden me what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship, but why would the corpses vanish?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have been put in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families to surrender their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of corpses is the last abominable act that can be done to man.</seg>

<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving license, last month witnessed a particularly misappropriated translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word" "older motorist" "means" "older motorist", "falsely - but perhaps also with evil rear-thought and # 8212; translated as" "fearful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1-20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"adaptation of the original Joshua Levine photos, widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes, an inhabitant of Kyotos, who made the local newspapers aware of it."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which is appearing in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could such an English translation come from?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the designation" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture has apologized for translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "fearful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "dreadful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists who are involved in accidents is quite a cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors generated 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to override, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still produce translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as ornaments. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">"main page of the port" "Navegar con Libertad" "(Frees Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)."</seg>
<seg id="392">"on Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay."</seg>
<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also contributed recordings of the protests in Caracas organised by oppositional groups that oppose the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the duties of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to requests of specific domains."</seg>
<seg id="406">"if a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server answers erroneous or denied the request for the call of such a website."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"she who has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she became ten years old she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or her underage daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted up."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadilla - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated for the Criadilla, generally guarantees silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who is their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education, improve their position in society, and" make something out of themselves, "are handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and whose exploitation is justified by faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is ill-treated, his family will experience it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred which takes place in seclusion in Paraguayan households, but a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguaú, her body showed traces of heavy blows. shortly thereafter she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved to Marín as long as she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," lamented Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl, who was her Criadita, to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes before court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, but also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign in bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that her still time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve but also did not get unlimited food." I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house as food out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, changed by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Released under the public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliamentarians have recently voted for a bill on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up which is in order to give citizens a permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register with their correct names and identity card numbers on the site to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that is running and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users from the telecommunications ministry received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist at the Egyptian Event for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that's a crazy system to monitor people's activities and to lead them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensuring that no different narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of the leopards, which strikes through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza is passionately fond of a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs in Nature for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">"since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and advocates that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region are set up."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the responsible daily Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was an extraordinary prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring cities Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had disappeared whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture still had a nuclear accident, and alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of emergency shelters (" "Kazetsu juutaku" ") still tries to relocate to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such expeditions."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the Evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were hauling after the disaster, were evacuated to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of fishing harbours are in operation in Iwate and Miyagi, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian country, have suffered large-scale suffering."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land have been cultivated by Fukushima, located in the" "nuclear barrier zone". ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it seems more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys conducted by the local population and under the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more information about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention was done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also witness of the worst disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the state of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophic areas most of the Evacuees, who still live in shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are known to be in real habitation because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima are to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="690">Welcome to a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do them using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lived in Montreal and worked in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and worked together with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop prompts the young participants to discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases were not solved."</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always speak native languages to the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group who gave them a rophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German language:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will forgive our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead of our youth</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of dishes" ") of every dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic meals and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district of Kappabashi there are a number of small companies that produce the plastic courts, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic meals are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend turns them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the extremists and the killed regularly appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses, such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa-Kartell, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that's why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking "), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how afraid life changes" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves according to his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday, we are again preparing ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I know disease and sensationalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the hopelessness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" "wet". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to persuade themselves that they remain unaffected by such tragedies, if they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family with threats had been plundered." it describes how armed criminals press money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never goes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy, for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father, which was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Ombudsman for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor numbered 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8,5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who have not forgotten us."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 launched the journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but what's the year after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its initial release, it has been misled to portray tragedies that were actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions to our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank car traversed Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck came to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinemas nearby which was full of people who watched the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered across the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count corpses," "said a Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been shattered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments such as this example falsely related the image from the DR Congo to sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts resembled the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claimed by Burma's Than Being, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to portray this information."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent imagery has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal is equated to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent imagery sensitize readers and viewers and to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how forcible media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is much to be discussed concerning violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will need to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or completely abusive."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (eg. insurmountable) endeavours to provide language enthousies a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">"some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobdela)."</seg>

<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>

<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, is the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the world's languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are, to belong to it."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening to often is associated with it, "these events instead" listen "to make sense, to feel, to socialize."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and representation lead to the fact that the audience is insisting on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the significance of his parable, John Nyamara is asked:" how is it to speak to an audience who doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend it. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story-stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started in the Dominican Capitol, the capital of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was called by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Ciudadano Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishing debts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding allowance, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the state alliance integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "an independent non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law for government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed from outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration wore the name "Night vigil for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for shared knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled" "Collective Remembrance" "gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time-to-time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in prison for Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes were more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working, the IS would put everything in it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strike in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion, sharing his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"in addition, Ghazi is the author of Waiting (waiting), a visiting book that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the texts to him, when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodorino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other defendants for the dismissal of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose Council was Chief Financial Officer of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who submitted the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer back to his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedures after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't like the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrizu de Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently kept silent and caused no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the media social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "contrary to the contrary" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had left off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is willingly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil, says the Director no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and to serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so honoured."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief enters the prison:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censoring many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or mockpeas."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took up their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "to" "(in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used by ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evokes hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (age lens), 'Kalar OAT' (chimel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty manner whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence of ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet's opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism doesn't understand what you write on account.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(Chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not persist for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new policy from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting posts, posts and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post" didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "stools" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a great deal of sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post says" If you are a doctor, then heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is said to heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the territory of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the exhilarating hate speech on his Burmese side, criticised."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"before this change of the marriage network, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, it came to a great public outcry. at that time, Brother Harryforad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN children's rights convention, the minors are defined as" "every person under the age of 18". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"the UN Statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children, already married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, trying to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the childrens, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was adopted against the toe of children - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1396">"although many tech-traversed Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>

<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just sat at home when I suddenly called Navarresh (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a phone call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>

<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran up with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyerga and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a married family with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of calling their wives also not by name is common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers as well as housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the degradation of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini Paz has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage right up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and directs those clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak out the names of their husbands, is a custom that they maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never known her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to speak the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pais from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only chiching herself, another decided to let out the whole frustration of him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient bronce, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received many reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law gazed at her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation ran out of violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the cinder-red dot if he would do it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the club club is a safe place where they can share opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline-kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of curta (upper shirts) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to tell the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to tell the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberish on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggle for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken from.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(State Danger) after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" an internal issue, "and a spokesman told him that he considered it" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to call for calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"at the end of June, Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and the rest of Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports since 2010 were largely blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Lius as reported in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told that the Americans would wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him in his recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the message asks the Chinese authorities not only release Liu, but also release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US Embassy drew a furious answer from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns about whether the vortex could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China demanded that Liu provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius attorney told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always oversee the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada urges China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the United Kingdom</seg>

<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "turning the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmuamalgam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of the fact that it inevitably appears undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre merges from the authoritarian rulers who are pretending to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the last week of Shanmuamalgam the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system were really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng asks Shanmuiden to illustrate his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a land, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our VK Shanmuiden would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out to the critiques that one should start reading the full transcript of the conference, so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmuiden, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we were enjoying free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously did not refer to it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"lement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - be I with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmuiden, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, correctly associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "faithfully commit a mistake" or was it a Freudian slip?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmuiden's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, but do they not defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is tending and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country especially "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series dealing with rumors about certain parts of the world and showing another facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series is written by Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question most commonly asked me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry, I'll answer." I'm from Canada. "since 1994 I have been living in Japan again and again."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." "many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger if they are held for Americans, but it doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began traveling around the world 20 years ago, before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"we obviously say" "apology" "very often."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, to be called" "nice" "means being idle - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(one of his own Canadian double-goers)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can bump yourself."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"it can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main feature of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about fence over the fence.</seg>

<seg id="1781">"the new song" Dictator Girl "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man, who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not expressly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The dictator" "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, as well as the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these photos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army an absolute decision on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th Rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program to" change the settings "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered as critics by the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and prosecute persons accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and internet users are threatened with long imprisonment, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border from Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken has been published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula and is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez talks, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is sick, she buys medication which she cannot pay, she massages the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together, and that the Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards, in order to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers with a smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez narrates that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have received migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after living for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single executive, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives and tries to decide where to go next."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the hallways, the travelers consult quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen, which she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users who are looking to be" "dazzling" ""</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi have received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" "preventing access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"police report states that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and the south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China "(to be a real erronym), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage by the rest-watching technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ("" Xingray "") also published a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can uplift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government, government and party related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a current Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urummai's three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1999">"but if reality restores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings out of flesh and blood, and everything screams after death."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that is stuffed up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had calmed down after the power supply ceased functioning in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my rooftop.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resonate with the silence.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed the whole way up to the office of security service from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect and prevent state security from us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional blackmail card and betrayed the close eye-field of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a land; it is a curse that they call coexistence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me that way."</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, although I had done nothing to earn this penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its variety.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner delights in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams didn't fall enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>

<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>

<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as fellowyee (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapbook music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he has a special reluctance against American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as a" Palestinian "second generation," he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a person," "while he poured in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with a protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the key words speak fluffy coffee and the checkweighers of the Kent cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan made an appearance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms, and is the main reason for the concert evening."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which challenges the well-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to choose" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply asymmetric rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib moved traditional men's men to Leibe, completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently trampled unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they were supposed to trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, in Jordan, the number of 'Honorary Mordes' has increased - unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honourable killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still appalling that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murders or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison," "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"however, Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and opinion, and cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been fooled to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words," can get what you want "- be it belief or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexuals and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview to the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to later note that his comments were torn, twisted and censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nude, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuda, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service denounced several former government officials and members of the Teaching Union, with the reason that they have critically reflected on comments in social media about the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially-led democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing have been handed down over more than one thousand years, in which armies marched from west Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissivity."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youths away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair course."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the failed hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdresser's competition" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their guns against hairdressing tools, and instead of poor advice to get training in hairdressing, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community with love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" love messages to guerilla fighters, "published by the international online magazine" Tea after Twelve. ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it much more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la colliación campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal detention for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried arms around the clock must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians joined together and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was created at the summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people, who needed the most urgent response this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation moved to the camp to personally overtake the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive any orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "told the political student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the guerilla fighters camp."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cameras" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters lived) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty sleep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"but I said to him," "Hello, what are you doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote me something like that, so I answer it." then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I firmly embraced him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sad to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices for new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no voting rights, and realizing that people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"for example, Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"gay and queer people living in the Caucasian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs just like a Damoklesschwert above the local LGBTQ community is not only created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya won the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that deal with the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen Authorities that arrested queer queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced from the sexual equation of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she eventually moved into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round trip through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on October 10, 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I came to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long will you still honor the family, you sweat stains?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had received everything and began to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which cases, you have been placed - in the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he has handled respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they posed absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to cope with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only disappointed your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she took a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 thread."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights guardians checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message:" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it's number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian items I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who are localized?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for me, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who imprisoned in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan people were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there's not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives, in order to put themselves in the court of Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there, so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in argun for a month and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already well known in the whole of Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "civilisation", "but in the end it was thrown back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, bore tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never insulted me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, was a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Spice is not about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they thought you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but above all about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could sense how the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation worsened in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreff, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't get a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded Zuid.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to clear you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dageants have which, the Cabarins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, there are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transience to men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know I'm myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he lit up himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors had nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Hamid manifest, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - were hanged."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all the family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran in 1925."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories, where the provinces meet Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who had a job, completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimoi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise in the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi males. "</seg>
<seg id="2423">"the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be hired, because even Arabic names are not tolerated in the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today still earn less money despite the same schooling than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still pulling crosswise through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift their voices and "Kumbaya, my Lord," to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustice in her mind, which refers both to sex and to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically a dehumanised and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimilation in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to be silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than engaged in a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and to move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recruiting: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call for separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman, I am recognized as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with a surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman appeared to Balbuena for mistreatment, Ada Báez also did nothing useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Impacts and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system, nothing underestimated 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Ecology, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. at 70% of them there was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women came here, too."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." "for every woman detained in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then she did."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the hardest recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed it so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives, they didn't get any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an immanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the announcement of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# Printer)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Increditors) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown by agreement"</seg>
<seg id="2588">"in the media, medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all. this is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious implications in Africa's poorest countries, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists itself helps to build its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed serious impacts on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he studied the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices: what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian National Program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines are only accessible for payment (called" "Paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India, such as" Open Source "seed producers to change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredressing, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many salad types he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or leafy leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants, such as cereal or board varieties. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food safety are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds lettuce, but he needs longer, since his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to thread.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before court, no one can breed any new type of salad, because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten the red tube salat of the "greenhouse" variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested that plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds they have bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, "the recent examples of the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which, for example, are offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking because of the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, employed a genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that masked plants like wheat are patented in an even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for growers decreases with more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predicable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company advocates the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, as patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection is not inhibiting innovation, but fosters them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton believes it is different: wait for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly grants no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether, Morton interferes with the concept of using plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants they form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret to nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures whose cultivation requires massive herbicides to grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through the avoidance of plant patents:" it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years, with which one makes it very simple in my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements a" open-source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also assists them in coming to "open source" seeds and selling their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol works on an open-source license, which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation can not simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law yet; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, for which the official launch of the seed should be launched next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from relief organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused above all on where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role in this," said Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for websites and media that are inaccessible in Egypt."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, which is also home to Canada's blog, is still accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video about how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a comment on Facebook, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this meant for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has in the era of Abdelfatal Jtah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"I succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the closure of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this yielded technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"apart from that, afte also documented the blocking of suppliers through the circumferment of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these acts."</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>

<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a weapon of war in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to information from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for people."</seg>

<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began using the" "production of mushrooms coming from the regions" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"brandies were also registered in Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 eruptions in the northern and central regions of the country, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy occurred where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the area of Lisbon."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and anti-fire measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the federal government of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">They did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits in locations with a high risk of fire will be questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the shape of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law allowing the construction activity from fall to fall if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorvos continues in the same article of Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of readily inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are added to the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants looked for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used the own civilian protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed fires, not counting more than half a million requests."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, always came closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his flight, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him ill."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "recalls Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services and no heating there. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we could not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran, and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum requests, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas, but it is also true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "special recording centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who do not have money for an accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbounded willingness to live helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, a number of Afghans run operations, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>

<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the disapproval of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which has been applied by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the harsher penalties for the insult of the president or senior officials would be introduced."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the law's proposal, such action would be punished with imprisonment and fines, thus legal experts from Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this may involve up to three years imprisonment for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in jeopardy for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the Egyptian police, while using violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatened with death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on false charges of inter alia ceasefire, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi session blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"said plan is provided by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, expressly provides a controversial bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all unlawful preserved monies."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21st on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources with article 11 of the Tunisian press codex which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he acted as a witness in the Tunis Regional Court on 09th May."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID card?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration will be necessary with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively, in order to protect citizen journalism and independence."</seg>
<seg id="2957">Will we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat missed to register with the state government as the" organiser of disseminating information. ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that provide the" disclosure of information. "the law allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing them on request for the removal of user data."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"these websites currently include sites such as Vkontakte and Odlo Clasniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the mail service Mail.ru and dozens of other services."</seg>
