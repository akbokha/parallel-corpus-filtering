this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally over@@ laid plans for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has established against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous journalists already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen has been living with the risk of going to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had years of information that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves increasingly less .
&quot; instead of failing to make statements , they could also carry out their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone secretly in secret , &quot;
&quot; like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ale &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers during his accession . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ cker went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot;
&quot; but just as government technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they are in contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous &quot; &quot; Aaron Swar@@ tz &quot; , &quot; and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ dropping is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technological break@@ through@@ s like Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to reveal the ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental colleague , who warns of the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an idea of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in control ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it to myself like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ del .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now , who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. countries you need less information , need less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially prone investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspected money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all right up to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course none of them was handed over to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single leader politi@@ cian , implic@@ ated in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to do this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; that may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic took political atten@@ tiveness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US la@@ gs behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of in@@ transparency through laws .
&quot; together , we can finally end the transparency that now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a post@@ age res@@ ale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da was standing and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Look , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ ear@@ ing at the toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; today , the work of art he bought from me hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red through the whole city with them . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can focus on things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
most of the guests feel so comfortable if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just so , who is actually Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the post of President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 judgments that all say : &quot; he can really steal very well un@@ locked cell phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we entr@@ ust the people most who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation causes simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted passion .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much money is offered . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Great art works in your home ! I make holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a demand that was previously not covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who in@@ vari@@ ably celebrate parties or rav@@ aged homes .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million recorded over@@ nights had a problem . &quot;
for men have confidence in one another .
&quot; if trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they leave one to stay longer without charge of extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay does not exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
&quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy refers to a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; however , what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that has never been heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project was already begun . many car parks belonging to the government , &quot;
now residents were offered . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were given to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that with the components of confidence one can find the right design . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it ast@@ ounding , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we will be able to use in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; in this way , the media represent people who look like me . &quot;
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know them .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atics
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , for me , it was a declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , turned into question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you somehow ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and began like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly transformed into ou@@ trage .
why should I do this ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; bombs Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start studying the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I sat down -- as we drove in silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I felt the first time to be known as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be angry . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; and again the warnings were saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were considered Muslims , locked up and hit them . &quot;
there were really sho@@ cks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people attacked this land attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malicious or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; it may be a few parking lots , but not stop the terror . &quot;
regular attendance of a mosque leads to more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology behind their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not do what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; every minister with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense for her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we are afraid of at least three things happen .
&quot; we accept more of an authorit@@ arian system of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit news@@ letters reports in which negative about Muslims was reported , they would rather vote military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the allocation of collective debt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ an was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when have I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ an eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or remain safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopping me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I have been broken . &quot;
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia seems to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder , what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception rather than the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am no exception in any way .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ packing became part of our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flying devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
they can also build independently ho@@ ist structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possible possibilities in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room ; calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands can be found on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a plane trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most startup acceler@@ ators , it can float , and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often point out fundamental abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest Remote @-@ powered flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ roads , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens a lot so that it can fly swiftly and move everywhere in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant rear @-@ starter algorithm . to make it fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability to really disc@@ ard it when all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abo@@ und ?
they see that he is usually symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; in this way , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things are conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or a prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can still fly , albeit restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making half of it un@@ fit .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we accepted standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , on the other hand , wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the wage is in development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; some 1.3 billion years ago , there was a life of several days on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fishes , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of specially brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which originate through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
that &apos;s why you call it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o started a last trial to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and my departure from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , that was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ her in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform correctly al@@ ber@@ ing dance in courses on rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stre@@ wn by us when the waves arrived . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and , with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , as you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features like sound and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity can tell us much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ie with an additional key signature change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu : wu : &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what he has to hear recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us think briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is making an entirely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because they are op@@ ak .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own glow . &quot;
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in the first run Lig@@ o found things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that highlight black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the dust particles for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events happening in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; Yes &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to stop talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very proud . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produced television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : 24 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world . &quot;
do you know who else is doing that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just hanging around on the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a portrait of a high sound , I deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sum , that I am talking about writing that writing is giving me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does them . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and work , when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this matter , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can not strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love summ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more shows , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sw@@ um , the sw@@ um , the sw@@ um . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her m@@ um is a single head of work .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there but you can write my n@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 , and 1 , when the sum was stopped . &quot;
the tot@@ als of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job any more .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , with all their heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing what you are doing , being a teacher , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the sum when you know the hum@@ ming , when you know the hum@@ ming , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern nation @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I already want to say No when two things are aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she calls no &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sums are smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum , I can do nothing but watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that does not happen immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working sums , the titanium sum , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum is dependent upon love .
the tot@@ ality is the current coming from the z@@ est of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real money ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do it as a rule so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice , if I want to hear the sum again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing isn &apos;t up to me how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better working than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; in doing so , I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ age daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I &apos;m mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no more need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring up 15 minutes a day , even in a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner prepared for children .
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I reti@@ re and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not I ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the canvas , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the other , the right sum : the hum@@ ming of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , constant , bare and new feeling of life spreads within me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; that is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ sur@@ geons are very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self healing ability . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; they must imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen by skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity and environments in order to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
&quot; and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the removal point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we can implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ post the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we could work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we found an injury and they re @-@ planted just the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we were injured in the motor @-@ motor @-@ area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you can see the monkey that spontaneously re@@ stores .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take you to reach the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to regard them as a matter of course .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them to be un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece .
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my appe@@ ased friends , who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group is mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; Twin Camp Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt hill , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt hill , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who , however , are too timi@@ d to invest where it would be productive and yield income with which one could wear the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blow up the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an infinite loop , feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they would not invest . &quot;
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances leading to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to fund especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy as a result of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the democracy of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the toil@@ ing poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they allowed them to grant them the right to political participation with equal voice wei@@ ghting in questions of state interests . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democr@@ ati@@ zed zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , by gradually putting the economy down and escap@@ ing it . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated them at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has stagn@@ ated the policy so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; this is , by the way , no new idea . &quot;
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the toil@@ ing arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the toil@@ ing poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts more deeply , as it will come -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ organise the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that in the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve the human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions to indulge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it take to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar to D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
&quot; no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peak . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is also the liberal , in whom it prefers privileged persons , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine genuine democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner by the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good @-@ bye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive compensation line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes happen it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example , Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors imposed upon us this policy stood up : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all this and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone will not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; of Roy Price , most have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior lecturer at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ cut and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ ques , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located to the right of this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 , and the amount shows how many shows have received this rating . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not concerned about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean expul@@ sion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon has nothing to do with free things , don &apos;t get involved in it ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or watch again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 , i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , the shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question now is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because the logic says somehow that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always produce the best results . it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flow into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what otherwise they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they were always able to say : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what we say . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to not forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a yes or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will test it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
