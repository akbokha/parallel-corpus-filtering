<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally overlaid plans for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has established against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous journalists already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen has been living with the risk of going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had years of information that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves increasingly less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing to make statements, they could also carry out their digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone secretly in secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risale's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers during his accession. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blocker went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as government technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they are in contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous" "Aaron Swartz", "and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedropping is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technological breakthroughs like Edward Snowden have the opportunity to reveal the iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental colleague, who warns of the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money] in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.] this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an idea of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in control havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to myself like a matryodel.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now, who were present in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but due to the principle that these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. countries you need less information, need less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed scammers to rip off especially prone investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspected money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all right up to a lawyer made proposals to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course none of them was handed over to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader politician, implicated in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to do this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"that may sound very melancholy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen an increase in transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attentiveness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of intransparency through laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the transparency that now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after finishing my design studies, I made a postage resale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda was standing and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go for peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Look, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shearing at the toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"today, the work of art he bought from me hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"to house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate withdraws and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured through the whole city with them. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can focus on things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the guests feel so comfortable if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who is actually Al Gore's mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the post of President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he told him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgments that all say: "he can really steal very well unlocked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we entrust the people most who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation causes similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooted passion.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much money is offered."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, for example" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "Great art works in your home! I make holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that was previously not covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who invariably celebrate parties or ravaged homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million recorded overnights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one to stay longer without charge of extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay does not expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy refers to a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that has never been heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project was already begun. many car parks belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Now residents were offered. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that with the components of confidence one can find the right design."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it astounding,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we will be able to use in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"in this way, the media represent people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know them.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull fitness fanatics</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, for me, it was a declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, turned into question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet loves you somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and began like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" Breaking. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly transformed into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...,..." "in the name of Islam...,..."... "..."... "... jihad...,..."... "bombs Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start studying the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I sat down -- as we drove in silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I felt the first time to be known as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't be angry. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were saying," "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were considered Muslims, locked up and hit them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really shocks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may be a few parking lots, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular attendance of a mosque leads to more tolerant towards people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology behind their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one looks at them, they do not do what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"every minister with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense for her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we are afraid of at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more of an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit newsletters reports in which negative about Muslims was reported, they would rather vote military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood against Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the allocation of collective debt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>

<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or remain safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw was stopping me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I have been broken."</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-packing became part of our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flying devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build independently hoist structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possible possibilities in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room; calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found on the highest level. for example," "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most startup accelerators, it can float, and has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turmoil like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often point out fundamental abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand moveable parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest Remote-powered flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossroads, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens a lot so that it can fly swiftly and move everywhere in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant rear-starter algorithm. to make it fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to really discard it when all watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospels is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abound?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is usually symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, it receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things are conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or a propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can still fly, albeit restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making half of it unfit.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard micro-quadcopters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine, on the other hand, wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the wage is in development and creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"some 1.3 billion years ago, there was a life of several days on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fishes, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of specially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which originate through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">That's why you call it Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo started a last trial to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves roamed through the earth through the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And my departure from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusher in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often perform correctly albering dance in courses on relativity theory."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and strewn by us when the waves arrived. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and, with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, as you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain features like sound and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same pie with an additional key signature change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu: wu:"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard: [Surrender's noise] Someone who knows what he has to hear recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is making an entirely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes occur at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because they are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own glow."</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, in the first run Ligo found things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that highlight black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dust particles for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events happening in space, the origin of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say" Yes "to everything I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" Yes. ""</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to stop talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very proud."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: 24 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I created myself and not only produced, so above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just hanging around on the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say that it's not dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a portrait of a high sound, I deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the sum, that I am talking about writing that writing is giving me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does them."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began to work and work, when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this matter, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can not strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love summing."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more shows, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things are happening at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the swum, the swum, the swum."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overstated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mum is a single head of work.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there but you can write my nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3, and 1, when the sum was stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job any more.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, with all their heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing what you are doing, being a teacher, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the sum when you know the humming, when you know the humming, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern nation-waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way to the outside, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say No when two things are aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me" kitten. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she calls no" "kitten". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my sums are smoother, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of sum, I can do nothing but watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky finger and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that does not happen immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working sums, the titanium sum, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent upon love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totality is the current coming from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real money ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do it as a rule so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice, if I want to hear the sum again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing isn't up to me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of person is better working than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydreaming."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I'm mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no more need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring up 15 minutes a day, even in a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner prepared for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the sums, have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I retire and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not I... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but only one part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I'm not sure I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the luckier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvas, the high sound, the sum, the sum, the other, the right sum: the humming of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, constant, bare and new feeling of life spreads within me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think things out, I awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"that is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"neurosurgeons are very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self healing ability."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known" "deep-brain stimulation". "in doing so, an electrode is implanted in the brain to influence the neurons' circuits so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they must imagine that the brain is swollen by skull-brain traumas, and the cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find the correct diet, temperature, humidity and environments in order to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the foetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-planted them at the removal point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we can implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-post the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we found an injury and they re-planted just the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we were injured in the motor-motor-area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey that spontaneously restores.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take you to reach the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicentric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first of all, it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to regard them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them to be unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my appeased friends, who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup is mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are brighter, our future gloomy, and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "Twin Camp Paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt hill, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt hill,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who, however, are too timid to invest where it would be productive and yield income with which one could wear the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion US dollar spent at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to blow up the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an infinite loop, feared the pessimism of investors, in which they would not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances leading to the fact that Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to fund especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to diminish the value of the Athenian democracy as a result of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the democracy of Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the toiling poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they allowed them to grant them the right to political participation with equal voice weighting in questions of state interests."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very brightly, it is burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratized zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, by gradually putting the economy down and escaping it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated them at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has stagnated the policy so far that it is harming itself by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"this is, by the way, no new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the toiling arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the toiling poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts more deeply, as it will come -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reorganise the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy which makes the film" matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that in the" matrix, "in which machines serve the human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long discussions to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take to look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar to Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peak."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is also the liberal, in whom it prefers privileged persons, and Marxian because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner by the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West's view on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say this provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say good-bye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive compensation line passed through the eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to choose denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes happen it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example, YV: everybody who looks back -- Seriously..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's creditors imposed upon us this policy stood up: "this was a colossal mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this and despite the aggressive sound of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"of Roy Price, most have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior lecturer at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a haircut and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Techniques, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located to the right of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10, and the amount shows how many shows have received this rating."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like Breaking Bad," Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not concerned about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean expulsion, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon has nothing to do with free things, don't get involved in it?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or watch again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5, i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, the shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question now is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic says somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produce the best results. it's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that data analysis can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flow into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you disassemble this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what otherwise they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they were always able to say:" "that's what we say."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to not forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a yes or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will test it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
